This Folder Contains A single file for each category (degrade20, degrade5, and original).
That file is FR940104.0 (same filename for each of the three) and is the first file in the TREC-5 Database.
This is used for testing the program. When running the code on the actual TREC-5 all that needs to be done is changed the default location of
TREC-5 database and a different file name indicated.
