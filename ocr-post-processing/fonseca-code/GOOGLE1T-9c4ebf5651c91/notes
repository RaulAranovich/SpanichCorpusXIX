Im going to keep notes on what i do as i get this running to make sure it all works. and the steps i take so i know the running procedure
this will also be useful for writing on paper instructions on how to run or at least making a bash script to run it

we are running into issues with upper vs lowercase file names. we need to go back and change the names to avoid isses in non linux machines

Need to update and reconsider README files
