Quick Start Guide:

We recommend running the libsvm experiment with the normalized data set as this gives the best result.

LIBSVM EXPERIMENT:

Go to Directory:

		RegressionTREC5/libsvm-3.23/python

and execute:

		RegressionTREC5/libsvm-3.23/python$ python3 trec5svm.py > svmTERMINALoutput.txt

to run an experiment.


Otherwise to view past experiments, go to:

		RegressionTREC5/libsvm-3.23/python/Results

Note: To modify the dataset used in an experiment, modify trec5svm.py  line 20.
This line contains the name of the dataset use. See lines 16-20 for different types:

#file = open('test_regression_matrix.txt', 'rU')                   #For testing with small data set
#file = open('regression_matrix.txt', 'rU')                        #Regular Version of DataSet from MySQL query
#file = open('ModifiedDataSets/std_regression_matrix.txt', 'rU')   #Version with Standardized DataSet
file = open('ModifiedDataSets/norm_regression_matrix.txt', 'rU')   #Version with Normalized DataSet

Different Data Sets.

To Modify the Train/Test ratio go to line 59 and change the .8 to any number. For example .9 will do 90% 10%
instead of the default 80% Train, 20% Test.

To run prediction on only the training data uncomment lines 60 and 72 and comment line 59.
See libsvm readme for different parameters
http://www.openpr.org.cn/files/help/rn01re18.html

To change the svm train parameters go to line 67. See libsvm readme for different parameters.
http://www.openpr.org.cn/files/help/rn01re19.html

For running a simple linear classification closest to regular logistic regression use line 68 and 
comment out 67.

To generate these files you can use the python files in ModifiedDataSets.
-trec5normalize.py : Normalizes data set.
-trec5smote.py : Over Sampling using SMOTE to make both classes equal.
-trec5standarize.py : Standardizes data set.

Next, we habve the trec5svmSMOTE.py version which uses Over Sampling for the under represented class 1.

To run this go to the same directory:

		RegressionTREC5/libsvm-3.23/python

and execute:

		RegressionTREC5/libsvm-3.23/python$ python3 trec5svmSMOTE.py > svmTERMINALoutput.txt

to run an experiment.

To view the results check the ModifiedDataSets/SMOTE directory along with the svmTERMINALoutput.txt in
the same directory as the python file.

Finally, is the scikit version, didn't achieve too good of results  but good if you are used
to scikit as a starting point. Most likely we could match regular svm given the right parameters.

SCIKIT EXPERIMENT:

For the SciKit edition, go to:

		RegressionTREC5/scikitSVMversion

and run:

		RegressionTREC5/scikitSVMversion$ python trec5svmV2.py > scikitSVMoutput2.txt

Note we added the 2 so it does not overwrite the previous version in case you wish to refer to it.
