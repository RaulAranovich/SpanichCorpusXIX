To run the SVM: 
Have the regression_matrix.txt file in the same directory as the trec5svm.py file.
These are found under ''/RegressionTREC5/libsvm-3.23/python''

Then type in the terminal pointing to that directory:


		TERMINAL$ python3 trec5svm.py > svmTERMINALoutput


When done. To see the time it took to run, you can do:


		TERMINAL$ tail svmTERMINALoutput


To find accuracy and other details, you can do:


		TERMINAL$ more svmTERMINALoutput


Be sure to backup the file after program execution finishes (3-7 hours) because if
you run the program again, it will overwrite the existing files!
