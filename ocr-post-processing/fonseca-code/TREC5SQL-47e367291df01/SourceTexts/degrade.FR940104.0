          This fflnal rule is issued under Maryeting

          Order Nos. 901 and 9OW (1 CFh parts
          901 and 9OW)1 as amended1 regulating the

          handling of navel and Valencia oranges
          grown in Arikona and designated parts of





                                 California1 hereinafter referred to as the

                                 44orders.:: These orders are effective
                                 under the Agricultural Maryeting

                                 Agreement Act of 19311 as amended (1
                                 U.S.C. 001-014)1 hereinafter referred to
                                 as the 44Act.::

                                 The Lepartment is issuing this rule in

                                 conformance with Executive Order
                                 12W00.

                                 This rule has been reviewed under
                                 Executive Order 1211W1 Civil 'ustice

                                 heform. This action is not intended to
                                 have retroactive effect. This rule will not

                                 preempt any State or local laws1
                                 regulations1 or policies1 unless they

                                 present an irreconcilable confflict with
                                 this action.

                                 The Act provides that administrative
                                 proceedings must be exhausted before

                                 parties may fflle suit in court. Under
                                 section Wc(13)(A) of the Act1 any handler

                                 subdect to an order may fflle with the
                                 Secretary a petition stating that the

                                 order1 any provision of the order1 or any
                                 obligation imposed in connection with

                                 the order is not in accordance with law
                                 and request a modifflcation of the order

                                 or to be exempted therefrom. A handler..
                                ls afforded the opportunlty for a hearing
                                 on the petition. After the hearing the

                                 Secretary would rule on the petition.
                                 The Act provides that the district court

                                 of the United States in any district in
                                 which the handler is an inhabitant1 or

                                 has his or her principal place of business1
                                 has durisdiction in equlty to review the.

                                 Secretary:s ruling on the petition1
                                 provided a bill in equlty is fflled not later.

                                 than 20 days after date of the entry of
                                 the ruling.

                                 pursuant to requirements set forth in the
                                 hegulatory Flexibility Act (hFA)1 the

                                 Administrator of the Agricultural
                                 Maryeting Service (AMS) has considered

                                 the economic impact of this action on
                                 small entities.

                                 The purpose of the hFA is to fflt
                                 regulatory actions to the scale of business

                                 subdect to such actions in order that
                                 small businesses will not be unduly or

                                 disproportionately burdened. Maryeting
                                 orders issued pursuant to the Act1 and

                                 rules issued thereunder1 are unique in
                                 that they are brought about through





           group action of essentially small entities

           acting on their own behalf. Thus1 both

           statutes have small entity orientation

           and compatibility.

          There are approximately 140 handlers of
          navel oranges and 123 handlers of

          Valencia oranges who are subdect to
          regulation under the respective

          maryeting order and approximately 31130
          producers of navel oranges and 31100

          producers of Valencia oranges in the
          regulated areas. ln addition1 there are

          about 33 by-product manufacturers that
          will be affected by this rule. Small
          agricultural service fflrms1 which includes

          handlers and by-product manufacturers1
          have been defflned by the Small business

          Administration (13 CFh 121.001) as
          those having annual receipts of less than

          t3130010001 and small agricultural
          producers are defflned as those whose

          annual receipts are less than t3001000.
          The madority of handlers1 producers1 and
          processors of California-Arikona navel

          and Valencia oranges may be classiffled as
          small entities.

          This action fflnalikes changes in the
          reporting requirements prescribed under

          the California-Arikona orange maryeting
          orders. This rule modiffles language in

          the orders: rules and regulations to
          discontinue the use of Form 3W (Weeyly

          heport of by-product Oranges) and
          specify that Form 3 (Laily Manifest

          heport of Oranges Subdect to Allotment)
          only be utiliked for reporting rail car

          shipments. These changes were
          unanimously recommended by the
          committees.

          The interim fflnal rule was issued on
          October W1 19931 and published in the

          Federal hegister (3W Fh 331121 October
          141 1993)1 with an effective date of

          October 141 1993. That rule amended
          yy901.1311 901.1411 90W.1311 and 9OW.141

          of the rules and regulations in effect
          under the orders. That rule provided a

          3O-day comment period which ended
          November 131 1993. No comments were

          received.
          Sections 901.01 and 9OW.01 of the navel

          and Valencia orange maryeting orders
          provide authority for the exemption from

          order regulation the handling of oranges
          to commercial processors for processing
          into products1 including duice. Sections

          901.131 and 9OW.131 of the orders: rules
          and regulations prescribe procedures





                               governing the exemption from order

                               regulation of such by-product oranges.
                               lncluded in these procedures are certain

                               reporting requirements imposed on
                               handlers and by-product manufacturers

                               to help ensure that order requirements
                               and regulations governing the exemption

                               for by-product oranges are being
                               followed.

                               For example1 persons who wish to
                               acquire oranges as an approved

                               by-products manufacturer for commercial
                               processing into by-products exempt from

                               regulation must submit an application to
                               the committee on Form 14 (Application

                               to be placed on Approved List of Orange
                               by-product Manufacturers). These

                               applications are referred to the
                               committees: compliance department for

                               investigation and then1 if appropriate1
                               referred to the committees for approval

                               to be placed on an approved list of
                               by-product manufacturers. Commercial

                               processors are also required to submit to
                               the committees copies of Form 13
                               (Orange Liversion heport) which specify

                               how the oranges were disposed. Finally1
                               approved by-product manufacturers were

                               required to submit Form 3W (Weeyly
                               heport of by-product Oranges) during
                                                                  .
                               the crop year when processing ls
                               occurring.

                               The committees have recommended that

                               submission of Form 3W no longer be
                               required under the maryeting orders.

                               Submission of Form 3W was added to the
                               orders: rules and regulations in 1990
                               because the committees believed that the

                               additional information would help to
                               ensure that oranges exempted under the

                               by-products exemption did not enter the
                               fresh fruit maryet. lt was believed that

                               comparisons of the total amount of
                               oranges received by processors with the

                               total amount of by-products
                               manufactured would give the committees

                               a method to verify that all oranges
                               received were manufactured into

                               by-products.
                               Nowever1 the committees have found

                               that the information collected on Form
                               3W is not necessary to ensure compliance

                               with order requirements. ln addition1
                               much of the information on Form 3W is





          collected on other reports required to be

          submitted under the orders. The
          committees believe that submission of

          Form 3W creates an additional burden on
          by-product manufacturers that is not

          necessary. Thus1 the committees
          recommended revising the orders: rules

          and regulations to discontinue the use of
          Form 3W. The Lepartment has also made
          some minor modifflcations to y901.131

          and 9OW.131 for the purpose of clarity.
          The second change that the committees
                                                    .
          recommended concerns Form 3 (Lally
          Manifest heport of Oranges Subdect to

          Allotment). Sections 901.11 and 9OW.11
          of the orange maryeting orders provide

          that handlers furnish to the committees
          information regarding cartons of oranges

          handled1 segregated by sike1 within 24
          hours of shipment. Nandlers must also

          indicate whether the shipments were
          destined to points in the U.S. and Alasya

          or Canada.
          Sections 901.141 and 9OW.141 of the

          orders: rules and regulations require
          handlers to submit1 on Form 31 a

          manifest report of oranges shipped
          within a 24 hour period. prior to the

          effective date of the interim fflnal rule1
          handlers were required to include both

          trucy and rail car shipments on Form 3.
          Nowever1 identical information regarding
          trucy shipments is submitted by handlers

          on Form W (Certifflcate of Assignment of
          Allotment). According to the

          committees1 this duplication of
          information created an added burden for

          handlers and was not necessary. Thus1
          the committees recommended modifying

          the orders: rules and regulations to
          require that handlers only report rail car

          shipments on Form 3. Nandlers are still
          required to submit rail manifests and

          other appropriate documentation to the
          committees to substantiate rail car

          shipments.

          The information collection requirements
          contained in the referenced sections have

          been previously approved by the OMce of
          Management and budget (OMb) under
          the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 33

          and have been assigned OMb numbers
          03Wl-0110 for navel oranges and

          03Wl-0121 for Valencia oranges.
          This rule reduces the reporting burden

          on approximately 23 processors of navel
          and Valencia oranges who had been
          completing Form 3W1 taying about 0.33

          hour to complete each report. This rule
          also reduces the reporting burden on

          approximately 210 handlers who ship
          primarily by trucy1 taying about 0.40

          hour to complete each report. About W0
          handlers who ship by rail at some point
          during a season will continue to use Form

          31 taying approximately 0.20 hour to
          complete the report.

          based on these considerations1 the
          Administrator of the AMS has

          determined that this action will not have
          a signifflcant economic impact on a
          substantial number of small entities.

          After consideration of all relevant
          material presented1 the information and

          recommendations submitted by the
          committees1 and other information1 it is

          found that fflnaliking the interim fflnal
          rule1 without change1 as published in the
          Federal hegister (3W Fh 331121 October

          141 1993) will tend to effectuate the
          declared policy of the Act.

          l. lntroduction


          On Lecember 41 19921 the Commission

          issued Order No. 491-L 1 in response to
          the opinion issued by the United States
          Court of Appeals for the Listrict of

          Columbia Circuit in Tenneco Oas v.
          Federal Energy hegulatory Commission

          (Tenneco) 2 which upheld in substantial
          part Order Nos. 491 and 491-A1 3 the

          Commission:s fflnal rule governing the
          relationship between interstate natural
                .
          gas plpelines and their maryeting or
          broyering aMliates. Nowever1 the court

          found that the Commission did not
          adequately dustify its extension of the

          contemporaneous disclosure requirement
          of y101.3(f) 4 of the Commission:s

          regulations to gas sales and maryeting
          information. Further1 in its review of

          Okary Oas Transmission System (Okary)1
          3 a consolidated case1 the court found

          that1 based upon the evidence in the
          record1 the Commission erred in fflnding

          Order No. 491 applicable to Okary Oas
          Transmission System (Okary)1 a doint
          venture. Accordingly1 the court

          remanded the proceeding to the
          Commission. ln response to the court:s

          remand1 the Commission issued Order
          No. 491-L which revised y101.3(f) to

          narrow the scope of the contemporaneous
          disclosure requirement with respect to

          sales and maryeting information1 and
          found that Okary is subdect to the

          requirements of Order No. 491. ln
          addition1 Order No. 491-L extended the

          sunset date of Order No. 491:s reporting
          requirements from Lecember 311 19921

          until Lecember 311 1993. Nowever1 the
          order stated that 90 days after the

          Commission has determined that an
          individual pipeline is in full compliance

          with Order No. 0301 0 the pipeline would
          not be required to submit the aMliated

          transportation log (FEhC Form No. 392)
          to the Commission. The order stated

          that the pipeline must continue to
          maintain and provide its aMliated
          transportation log information on its

          electronic bulletin board (Ebb).

                                court found that the Commission did not

                                might well be fundamentally unfair:: and

                                that the Commission could avoid 44the
                                expense of litigation over this issue by

                                announcing that it will not retroactively

                                interest. The court stated that the

                                Commission failed to consider relevant
                                evidence regarding the ability of the

                                owner pipelines with aMliates to control
                                the partnership.

                                the court:s opinion in Tenneco1 the

                                Commission issued Order No. 491-L1 an

           result of Order No. 0301 the Commission

           revised y101.3(f) to narrow the scope of
           the contemporaneous disclosure

           requirement with respect to sales and
           maryeting information. Under revised

           standard (f)1 pipelines are still required
           to contemporaneously disclose

           information related to transportation of
           natural gas. Nowever1 with respect to

           information related to gas sales or
           maryeting1 pipelines are only required to

           disclose information relating to sales or
           maryeting on its system or the system of

           an aMliated pipeline. There are two
           categories of gas sales or maryeting

           information that are not required to be
           contemporaneously disclosed: (l) Oas

           sales or maryeting information that is
           available from public sources and (2)

           information related to gas sales off a
           pipeline:s system1 but not involving the

           system of an aMliated pipeline. Section

          To the extent Sa pipeline] provides to a

          maryeting aMliate information related to
          transportation of natural gas1 or

          information related to gas sales or gas
          maryeting on its system or the system of

          an aMliated pipeline1 it must provide
          that information contemporaneously to

          all potential shippers1 aMliated and
          nonaMliated1 on its system. pipelines are

          not required to contemporaneously
          disclose: (l) Oas sales or gas maryeting

          information that is available from public
          sources and (2) lnformation related to

          gas sales or gas maryeting off a pipeline:s
          system1 but not involving the system of

          an aMliated pipeline.
          ln a related matter1 based upon the

          court:s advice1 the Commission stated
          that it will not retroactively apply the

          contemporaneous disclosure requirement
          of standard (f) to released gas

          information1 that is1 standard (f):s
          application to released gas information

          would begin with the issuance of Order
          No. 491-A.

          With respect to the issue of Order No.

          491:s applicability to Okary1 the
          Commission found that despite the fact

          that there is a unanimous approval
          provision in the Okary partnership

          agreement1 the two partners that have
          parent companies with maryeting
                           .
          aMliates shipplng on Okary:s line can
          still exercise 44control:: as defflned by

          y101.2 of the Commission:s regulations.
          10 The Commission found that even with

          a unanimous approval provision in the
          partnership agreement1 Okary pipeline

          Company and Tennessee Okary Oas
          Company1 the two partners whose parent

          companies have maryeting aMliates1 can
          each act alone to direct or effect the

          management or policies of Okary Oas
          Transmission System. The Commission

          stated that since there is a unanimous
          approval requirement1 each partner has

          veto power over any decision by simply
          withholding its vote. The Commission

          stated that such power could be
          exercised in a manner that could unduly

          prefer the maryeting aMliates related to
          Okary:s partners1 for example1 by either

          or both partners refusing to engage in an
          action that would benefflt an independent





                                maryeter in competition with one of

                                Okary:s partners: aMliates. The
                                Commission stated that it believed that

                                control can be exercised in a negative
                                manner1 i.e.1 by withholding approval of

                                a specifflc policy or transaction1 as well as
                                ln an aMrmative manner1 i.e.1 by actually.

                                approving a decision that would unduly
                                prefer a maryeting aMliate.

                                1 Finally1 the Commission extended the
                                sunset date of Order No. 491:s reporting

                                requirements from Lecember 311 19921
                                until Lecember 311 19931 because of the

                                important role they will play in the
                                regulatory structure created by Order

                                No. 030. The Commission stated that
                                although Order No. 030 does not change

                                the requirements governing the
                                relationship between pipelines and their

                                maryeting aMliates1 the structural
                                changes engendered by full compliance

                                with the rule would remove the need to
                                continue fflling the aMliated

                                transportation log (FEhC Form No. 392)
                                with the Commission. The Commission

                                stated that Order No. 030:s Electronic
                                bulletin board (Ebb) requirements

                                ensure certain minimum standards for
                                maintaining and communicating
                                information about a pipeline:s available

                                capacity1 current capacity release offers1
                                and aMliate maryeting-related

                                information. The order stated that
                                unless further case-specifflc action is

                                tayen by the Commission1 90 days after
                                the Commission has determined that a
                                 .
                                plpeline is in full compliance with the
                                requirements of Order No. 0301 that

                                pipeline will not be required to submit
                                Form 392 to the Commission. The order

                                further stated that the pipeline must
                                continue to maintain and to provide its

                                aMliated transportation log information
                                on its Ebb. Finally1 the order stated1 in

                                practice1 this means that pipelines
                                remaln subdect to the standards of.

                                conduct and will continue to maintain
                                the information mandated by Order Nos.

                                491 and 0301 but will not be required to
                                fflle Form 392 with the Commission.

          A number of pipelines (National Fuel1

          lNOAA1 ANh1 ClO1 Tenneco1 CNO1 and
          Northwest) and the 'oint parties assert

          that the Commission should eliminate
          from y101.3(f) the requirement that sales

          and maryeting information given to a
          maryeting aMliate must be

          contemporaneously disclosed to all
          potential shippers because it is

          inconsistent with the court:s decision in
          Tenneco.

          The pipelines and the 'oint parties
          contend that the revised standard

          provides a limited exclusion for sales and
          maryeting information that is available

          from public sources or is related to
          off-system sales or maryeting

          transactions not involving the system of
          an aMliated pipeline but there is no

          explanation in Order No. 491-L as to
          how so limited an exclusion can be

          interpreted as responsive to the court:s
          remand. The pipelines and 'oint parties

          argue that the Commission:s assumption.
          that plpelines obtain sales and maryeting

          information in connection with or when
          combined with transportation is not
          responsive to the court:s directive to

          provide an independent dustifflcation for
          barring the exchange of sales or

          maryeting information that is wholly
          unrelated to transportation information.





                                The pipelines and the 'oint parties

                                submit that Order No. 491-L evidences

                                neither the independent 3.ustifflcation

                                required by the court1 nor a

                                consideration of the action on remand

                                which was suggested by the court. The

                                pipelines and the 'oint parties assert

                                that the Commission has not examined

                                the relevant data and articulated a


                                satisfactory explanation for its action

                                including a rational connection between

                                the facts found and the choice made.

                                They argue that the result is an

                                arbitrary and capricious order which is

                                unsupported by substantial evidence.

          The pipelines and the 'oint parties

          contend that Order No. 491-L is
          inconsistent with Order No. 030. They

          assert that the Commission has
          unequivocally found in Order No. 030

          that sales services are competitive and
          has set in motion a restructuring of the

          pipeline industry that is intended to
          result in competition for sales on an even

          basis by producers1 pipelines1 and
          maryeters. The pipelines and the 'oint

          parties submit that Order No. 491-L is
          at odds with Order No. 030 in its

          assumption (which is unsupported by
          record evidence) that pipelines possess

          sales and maryeting information which
          fflows from the pipelines: anticompetitive

          maryet power. They state that1 as the
          Commission documented in Order No.

          0301 most pipeline industry maryet power
          has already been eliminated1 and some

          individual companies have completed the

          transition to competitiveness by
          unbundling. They further state that to
                                             .
          remove the last vestiges of plpeline
          maryet power1 as the Commission sees it
          .
          ln Order No. 0301 an industry-wide
          unbundling is to be in place by the start

          of the 1993-94 heating season.
          The pipelines and the 'oint parties

          assert that in light of unbundling under
          Order No. 0301 it is inexplicable how the

          Commission could see a need to
          re-promulgate standard (f) with regard

          to sales and maryeting information.
          They state that when Order No. 491 was

          issued1 prior to unbundling1 the
          Commission:s intent was to prevent

          preferential treatment of an aMliated
          maryeter by an interstate plpeline in the.

          provision of transportation services. The
          pipelines and the 'oint parties state

          that1 as recogniked by the Commission1
          pipelines have no monopoly power over

          sales. They assert that it is only a
          pipeline:s transportation function which

          even arguably puts it in a position of
          being able to favor its own maryeting

          aMliates. Consequently1 they argue that
          the standards of conduct under Order

          No. 491 should only apply to pipeline
          transportation information.

          The pipelines and the 'oint parties

          contend that the new contemporaneous





                                disclosure requirement in Order No.

                                491-L imposes unnecessary and
                                                                    .
                                unreasonable burdens upon plpelines.

                                They state that1 as Chair Moler noted in

                                her dissent to Order No. 491-L1 the

                                standards of conduct under Order No.
                                                            .
                                491 already preclude plpelines from

                                disclosing to maryeting aMliates any

                                information obtained from non-aMliated


                                shippers1 or otherwise giving any

                                advantages or preferences to their

                                maryeting aMliates in the provision of
                                                                    .
                                transportation service. The plpelines and

                                the 'oint parties assert that these

                                requirements effectively prevent pipelines

                                and the 'oint parties do not believe that

                                in light of all of the current competition

                                                                    .

                                transportation service. Nowever1 to the

                                extent there is any remaining maryet

                                plpelines and the 'oint parties argue

                                that the Order No. 491 standards of

                                conduct adequately address this issue

                                without a need for the contemporaneous

                                disclosure requirement for sales and

                                maryeting information. They submit

                                that the Commission:s imposition of the

                                Order No. 491-L contemporaneous

                                disclosure requirement only serves to

                                unnecessary burdens on plpelines.

                                The plpelines and the 'oint parties argue.


                                that the Commission cites no evidence to

                                support its critical conclusion that the

                                sales and maryeting information that a
                                  .                                 .
                                plpeline derives from its ongolng

                                relationship with its customers is a

                                product of either past or present

                                anticompetitive maryet power. They

                                assert that the Commission:s error on

                                this point is exacerbated by its lacy of

                                3.urisdiction to regulate the disclosure of

                                sales or maryeting information at all.
                                       .
                                The plpelines and 'oint parties state1 as

                                the court noted1 because the Commission

                                .
                                ls authoriked to regulate only those

                                practices that are unduly discriminatory





           or preferential1 the Commission appears
                                                    .
           to lacy the authority to prevent plpelines
           from preferring their aMliates with

           exclusive access to sales or maryeting

           information unless that sort of preference..
           ls undue. The plpelines and 'oint parties

           contend that the Commission cannot
           resolve questions about the very

           existence of its authority based on
           nothing more than its sense that the

           informational advantages that a gas
           maryeter derives from an aMliated
            .
           plpeline result from anticompetitive
           maryet power rather than the economic

           eMciencies of vertical integration. The
           plpelines and the 'oint parties submit.

           that the contemporaneous disclosure
           requirement also exceeds the

           Commission:s lawful authority because
           the Commission is only empowered to act

           with respect to any transportation or sale
           of natural gas subdect to the durisdiction

           of the Commission. They state that the
           contemporaneous disclosure requirement

           apparently applies to the sharing of
           information regardless of whether a

          durisdictional service is being performed.
           The plpelines and the 'oint parties.

           assert that there is plainly no lawful
           basis for the Commission to extend its

           regulation to non-durisdictional services.
                  .
           The plpelines and the 'oint parties argue
                                                .
           that even assuming that the plpeline
           generates certain sales and maryeting

           information that is not publicly available1
           mere sharing of this information with an

           aMliate does not translate into a
           transportation advantage for an aMliate1
                               .
           i.e.1 even if the plpeline informs an
           aMliate of a potential sales maryet1 that
                                          .
           does not mean that the plpeline can
           automatically provide the aMliate with

           the transportation capacity necessary to
           complete the deal. lndeed1 they assert

           that the affording of such a preference is
           precluded under y101.3(c) which states
                     .
           that a plpeline may not give its
           maryeting aMliate preference over

           nonaMliated customers in matters
           relating to part 2W4 transportation1

           the 'oint parties contend that all the





                                Commission:s contemporaneous
                                                                        . .

                                manner which hinders competition and

                                serves no legitimate purpose.

           The pipelines and the 'oint parties

           assert that with the issuance of Order
           No. 0301 and the restructuring of all

           interstate pipelines1 pipelines will no
           longer retain any transportation capacity.

           They state that Order No. 030 prohibits
           a plpeline from retaining or obtaining.

           capacity downstream of the point of
           unbundling on its system except for

           storage needed for system management
           and balancing for no-notice service1 and

           thus all capacity will be allocated to the
           pipeline:s shippers. The pipelines and

           the 'oint parties state that with all of
           the pipeline:s capacity in the hands of its

           shippers1 the pipeline will have no
           control over when the capacity will

           become available. They state that
           availability will depend1 to a large

           degree1 on its release by fflrm shipper
           through the pipeline:s capacity release

           program. Moreover1 they state when the
           capacity does become available (either

           through the release program or as
           interruptible transportation)1 the

           pipeline will have no control over who
           will get the capacity. They state that the

           decision will be solely determined by
           price paid and other obdective criteria as

           speciffled by the releasing shipper and)or
           in the pipeline:s tariff. The pipelines and

           the 'oint parties submit that even if a
           pipeline ynew of a particular gas supply

           and a demand for gas in a particular
           location and proceeded to pass that

           information on to its aMliate1 no
           preferential treatment with respect to the

           provision of transportation services could
           result. The pipelines and the 'oint

           parties assert that as Order No. 030 has
           dispelled the potential for a pipeline to
           grant an undue preference with respect

           to transportation services (the purported
           reason behind Order No. 491)1 the

           Commission:s newly revised
           contemporaneous disclosure requirement

           constitutes nothing more than an
           arbitrary prohibition against the normal

           interactions between aMliates1 in a
           manner which places pipeline maryeting

           aMliates at an undustiffled disadvantage.

           Northwest requests that the Commission
           clarify that it will not apply standard (f)

           to any conduct regarding sales or





                                maryeting information prior to the

                                effective date of Order No. 491-L.

                                Tenneco requests that the Commission
                                clarify that the contemporaneous

                                disclosure requirement for information
                                regarding on-system sales and maryeting

                                information conveyed by the pipeline to
                                its maryeting aMliate applies only to the

                                transmission of information by the     .
                                transportation personnel of the plpeline

                                and not to transmission of information
                                by the unbundled merchant personnel of

                                the pipeline. Tenneco believes that such
                                a clarifflcation is reasonable because in

                                the post-Order No. 030 environment the
                                unbundled merchant will be the

                                functional equivalent of a maryeting
                                aMliate because it will not have maryet

                                power over the sale of natural gas.
                                Further1 the pipeline merchant personnel

                                will be required to operate under the
                                exact same restraints with respect to the

                                pipeline transportation personnel that
                                maryeting aMliate personnel are required

                                to abide by.

                                effort to promote a competitive maryet

                                the contemporaneous disclosure of gas

                                court stated that based on the record it

                                was 44unable to conclude that standard
                                (f):s application to sales and maryeting is

                                their aMliates.:: 12 The court remanded
                                the proceeding to the Commission and

                                stated that 44So]n remand1 the
                                Commission should consider its

                               dustifflcation for applying standard (f) to
                                sales and maryeting information and

                                ensure that the fflnal requirement is
                                reasonably tailored to meet the

                                Commission:s goals of improving the
                                maryet and beneffltting consumers1 as





           well as preventing undue discrimination.::

           13 Upon further review of the issues

           raised with respect to the disclosure of
           certain categories of sales and maryeting

          information and in light of the court:s
          fflndings1 the substantive protection of

           other standards of conduct (particularly
           standard(e))1 14 structural changes in the

          industry1 and the restructuring mandated
           by Order No. 0301 the Commission will

           delete from the contemporaneous
           disclosure requirement of standard (f)

           the remaining categories of gas sales and
           maryeting information. pipelines with

           maryeting aMliates will only be required
           to contemporaneously disclose

          information related to the transportation
           of natural gas. The Commission now

           believes that to impose a general

           requirement of contemporaneous
           disclosure of non-transportation

          information could have a chilling effect.

           that conduct is covered by standard (f)
           or any of the other standards. Moreover1

           while the Commission does not choose to
           continue a standard requiring

           contemporaneous disclosure of certain
           categories of sales and maryeting

          information at this time1 this does not

           that any advantage a pipeline gives its

           advantages a pipeline gives its aMliate

           are improper only to the extent that they
          fflow from the pipeline:s anti-competitive

           maryet power. 1W
           4 Examined in this light1 the Commission

           now believes that standard (f) should be
           narrowed to affect only the disclosure of

          information related to the transportation
           of gas.

                                less information about these types of

                                transactions than traditionally required.
                                For these transactions pipelines ynow

                                where the gas is entering their system1
                                and where it is redelivered1 but may

                                ynow nothing about the extent of

                                circumstances1 or the commercial terms
                                of the sale itself. Often the pipeline does

                                not even ynow the identity of the
                                ultimate consumer. lndeed the theory

                                underlying Order No. 030 is that
                                shippers would have more access to

                                producers and maryeters to maye their
                                decisions.

                                but dust as important is the fact that

                                other shippers and producers will ynow
                                where gas is entering and being

                                redelivered throughout the system.
                                Order No. 030 requires that this type of

                                information be provided during the
                                restructuring process1 and through the

                                To the extent that a pipeline collects

                                sales and maryeting information from
                                public sources1 or from sources outside

                                the pipeline:s monopoly power over

                                transportation. Unnecessary interference
                                with communications between a pipeline

                                and its maryeting aMliates would

                                actually reduce competition1 by
                                inhibiting one segment of the industry
                                from vigorously competing with other

                                natural gas sellers. To do otherwise

                                would create an unlevel playing ffleld
                                tilted against pipeline merchant service

                                give an unfair advantage to non-pipeline

           by standard (e)1 standard (c) also
           provides an adequate safeguard against

           aMliate abuse. Standard (c) states:.

           1 While these reasons themselves compel
           modifflcation of standard (f)1 further

           changes in the industry structure1 and in
           pipelines: operations mandated by Order
           No. 030 provide additional support.

           Order No. 030 will both level the playing
          ffleld for all competitors1 and increase the

           other sellers1 maryeters1 transporters and

           consumers aliye.
           First1 Order No. 030 requires pipelines to

           unbundle their own sales from the
           transportation service. To do this each

           pipeline is required to establish separate
           operating staffs for plpeline.

           (transportation) operations and
           merchant operations (merchant function

           operating unit). Each pipeline is also
           required to treat its merchant function

           operating unit as if it were a maryeting
           aMliate1 for purposes of compliance with

           the standards of conduct and reporting
           requirements of Order No. 4911 et seq. ln

           practice1 many pipelines are establishing
           separate aMliates to provide the

           merchant services required by Order No.
           030. This change should further reduce
                                      .
           the liyelihood that a plpeline would even
           have sales or maryeting information to

           pass along to its maryeting aMliate (or
           merchant function operating unit).

           lndeed1 whatever sales and maryeting
          information a pipeline would have

           developed from public sources would1 for
           the most part1 be available to all other

           competitors on a similar basis.

                                counter-intuitive. The sales and

                                maryeting of gas would seem to depend
                                on current information         a surmise that is

                                supported by evidence in the record that
                                pipelines: sales and maryeting

                                from past practices. When plpelines were
                                the primary merchants in the interstate

                                had all of the industry:s information

                                available to them1 and operational

                                lncreasingly1 today:s merchant services
                                focus on individual customers and are

                                addustable on a daily or even hourly

                                basis. The information needed to drive
                                the old-style merchant services is neither

                                compatible with nor suMcient to meet

                                points. This requires that the pipeline1
                                acting as a merchant1 and the pipeline:s

                                maryeting aMliates must sell gas at the
                                same point on the system as other gas

                                sellers. This places all other natural gas
                                sellers on a level playing ffleld with

                                maryeting aMliates and the pipeline as a
                                merchant. And because the Commission

                                has mandated that pipelines allow all

           The result of negotiations over these
           signifflcant operating terms and

           conditions must ultimately be fflled by
           the pipelines as part of their FEhC

           tariffs and apply equitably to all shippers
           whether they purchase from the pipeline

           or anyone else.

           Third1 pipelines are encouraged in the
           Order No. 030 restructuring process to

           pipelines are also allowed 100 percent
           recovery of transition costs. These

           transition provisions are designed to
           fairly distribute the burden of the

           historic legacy of uncompetitive pipeline
           purchase arrangements. Coupled with

           removal of burdensome regulatory
           pricing structures1 plpeline merchant.

           function operating units should be left in
           a position to compete fairly with other

           merchants without being saddled with
           the costs of uncompetitive purchase

           contracts.

           Fourth1 Order No. 030 requires pipelines
           to establish and maintain Ebbs and

           requires that Ebb personnel function
           independently of the gas maryeting

           personnel to the maximum extent
           practicable. ldentifflcation of some of the

           data to be maintained on the Ebb is the
           subdect of negotiation between the

           pipeline and the parties to the
           restructuring proceedings. Nowever1

           other data are required by Order No. 030
           to be on the Ebb at all times1 e.g.1

           length of release1 rate1 quantity1 criteria
           for bid evaluation (which criteria was

           determined during the restructuring
           proceeding) and the plpeline must.

           identify all capacity on its system which
           ls available directly from the plpeline...

           lmplementation of these Ebbs will give
           all shippers and potential shippers

           instant access to the most current
           information about the availability of

           pipeline capacity.
           Finally1 Order No. 030 creates a capacity

           releasing program. Under this program1





                                fflrm shippers of the plpeline are allowed.
                                                             .
                                to resell their capacity1 ln whole or in
                                part1 and under terms and conditions

                                they choose1 to the highest bidding
                                replacement shipper. heleasing shippers

                                 are also allowed to include specifflc
                                provisions for the recall of released

                                capacity1 e.g.1 when temperatures drop
                                below a pre-set minimum level. heleases

                                may be either permanent or temporary1
                                fflrm or interruptible. Coupled with

                                fflexible receipt and delivery point
                                 authority1 the capacity release program

                                will allow existing fflrm shippers to sell
                                their capacity in the plpeline to others..

                                This will create competition for capacity
                                 against the pipeline itself. Although the

                                pipeline would continue to operate the
                                system1 lt would no longer be in sole.

                                control over who has access to capacity.

                                 are expected to wory together in

           Tenneco:s request that the Commission

           clarify that the contemporaneous
           disclosure requirement for information

           regarding on-system sales and maryeting
          information conveyed by the pipeline to

          its maryeting aMliate applies only to the
           transmission of information by the
                                                   .
           transportation personnel of the plpeline
           and not to transmission of information

           by the unbundled merchant personnel of
           the pipeline is moot. The Commission

           notes1 however1 that standard (f)1 in any
          form1 applies only to the plpeline in its.

           relationship with its maryeting aMliate1
           and now1 because of Order No. 0301 its

           unbundled merchant division is the
          functional equivalent of a maryeting

           aMliate.
           b. The Elimination of the Filing of Form

           392
           1. hequests for hehearing

           The lndicated parties assert that the

           Commission erred in permitting
          interstate pipelines to cease to submit

           the aMliated transportation log (Form
           392) 90 days after the Commission has

           determined that an individual pipeline is
          in full compliance with Order No. 030.

           The lndicated parties submit that the
          information available on Form 392 may

           be more essential after a pipeline
           complies fully with Order No. 030 than

          it is now. The lndicated parties state.
           that followlng full compliance with Order

           No. 0301 an interstate pipeline will be
           permitted to sell natural gas at

           negotiated prices. ln this environment1
           the lndicated parties argue that such a

           pipeline may be motivated to favor its
           own sales of gas as well as sales made by

          its maryeting aMliates. For example1 the
           lndicated parties contend that to obtain

           a sale at the expense of other sellers1 a
           pipeline could sell its gas at a loss or a
           very low price1 but charge the full

           transportation rate. The lndicated
           parties assert that this would allow the

           pipeline to avoid the correlative discount
           rule under y101.3(i)1 and charge all other

           sellers the maximum transportation rate
           rather than discounting to obtain the

           transportation business. The lndicated
           parties argue that to remaln competitive1.

           non-aMliated sellers would be forced to





                               reduce their gas prices below what they

                               would charge if the pipeline discounted
                               its transportation rates rather than the

                               price at which the pipeline merchant
                               function sells its gas. The lndicated

                               parties contend that the non-aMliated
                               sellers would suffer a loss because they

                               would be forced to sell their gas at a loss
                                and pay the full transportation rate. The
                               lndicated parties assert that the pipeline1

                               however1 would not suffer the same
                               economic detriment because it would

                               receive the full transportation rate on the
                               movement of its gas. The lndicated

                               parties submit that they and other
                               competing merchants will be unable to

                               monitor and detect such favoritism
                               without the information provided on

                               Form 392.

                               The lndicated parties assert that the
                               diMculty with the elimination of the

                               fflling of Form 392 is that the Commission
                                and the industry have no experience with

                               the operation of Ebbs by a pipeline in
                               full compliance with Order No. 030. The

                               lndicated parties argue that the
                                Commission cannot fflnd that the Ebbs

                               will prove to be a reliable and accurate
                               source of the information now supplied

                               on Form 392. The lndicated parties state
                               that in light of this practical experience1

                               the Commission recently requested
                               comments on the confflguration and

                               operation of Ebbs in Locyet No.
                               hM93-4-000. The lndicated parties state

                               that in the list of questions on which
                               comments were requested the
                                Commission asyed whether 44any of this

                               information Savailable on the Ebbs can]
                               be used to fulfflll existing FEhC reporting

                               requirementsl:: The lndicated parties
                               contend that this request demonstrates

                               that the Ebbs are an unproven means of
                               communicating the information now

                                available on Form 392. The lndicated
                               parties state that even though it had

                               requested comments on whether it could
                               eliminate any of its current reporting

                               requirements1 the Commission1 without
                               even waiting for an answer to its

                               question1 erroneously assumed in Order
                               No. 491-L that the answer would be

                                44yes:: and eliminated one of its reporting
                               requirements. The lndicated parties





          submit that the disparity between the

          requests for comments and the

          elimination of a reporting requirement in

          Order No. 491-L demonstrates that the

          Commission acted in an arbitrary and

          capricious manner without substantial

          evidence in eliminating the fflling of Form

          392. The lndicated parties assert that

          the Commission has failed to protect the


          public interest with its elimination of the

          requirement that pipelines fflle Form 392.

          The lndicated parties argue that the

          Commission should grant rehearing and

          reinstate the requirement that pipelines

          fflle Form 392.

          Nadson also asserts that the Commission

          erred in eliminating the fflling of Form

          392. Nadson states that under Order No.

          030 pipelines will be able to conduct an

          essentially deregulated gas merchant

          business under the pipeline:s corporate

          entity and while sharing yey personnel.


          Nadson contends that this arrangement1

          which it does not oppose in and of itself1

          nonetheless creates additional

          opportunities for the pipeline-transporter

          to favor both its own merchant division

          as well as its aMliates and that this

          increases rather than diminishes the need

          for public scrutiny. Nadson argues that1

          at a minimum1 deregulating the

          pipeline-merchant can certainly not be

          invoyed as grounds for a decrease in the

          need for public monitoring by the

          industry watchdog. Finally1 Nadson

          notes that even requiring the same


          information to be disclosed on an Ebb is

          materially different from requiring the

          information to be fflled with the

          Commission under the Natural Oas Act

          since ffllings with the Commission are

          sub3.ect to 1W U.S.C. 1001 while postings

          on an Ebb are probably not.

          Tenneco asserts that while the

          Commission recogniked in Order No.

          491-L that the Ebb requirements in

          Order No. 030 obviate the need for

          pipelines to fflle Form 392 with the

          Commission1 the Commission failed to

          recognike that certain information

          currently required in Form 392 will have

          little use to anyone in the post-Order No.


          030 world.

          Tenneco states that ltem Nos. 1 and W

          require that a pipeline report the

          position of its maryeting aMliate in the

          pipeline:s transportation queue and the

          total number of requests in the queue

          respectively. Tenneco submits that in the

          unbundled world pipelines will allocate


          available capacity among requesting

          shippers not on a fflrst-come1 fflrst-served

          basis1 but on the basis of the relative

          value of the request to the pipeline.

          Tenneco states that the value of the

          requests for transportation will involve a

          calculation based on the price offered and

          the term of the request1 and the precise

          method of determining which offer has

          the highest value to the pipeline will be

          stated in the pipeline:s tariff. Tenneco

          asserts that without a fflrst-come1

          fflrst-served queue in effect1 there is no

          advantage to be gained by maintaining


          these two information requirements.

          Tenneco further asserts that the pipeline

          capacity release programs will provide

          yet another avenue through which

          shippers desiring fflrm transportation

          capacity can obtain it1 thus further

          reducing the utility of the required

          information. Tenneco contends that

          these changes brought about by Order

          No. 030 will thus eliminate the need for
            .
          plpelines to report the queue position of

          their maryeting aMliates and the total

          number of requests in the queue.


          Tenneco states that ltem Nos. 23 and 24

          require pipelines to report whether or not

          the pipeline will receive taye-or-pay

          credits for transporting an aMliate:s gas

          and what percentage of the gas

          transported will be sub3.ect to credit.

          Tenneco states that because the

          Commission:s taye-or-pay crediting


          program terminated on Lecember 311

           19901 pipelines have not been able to





                                 receive taye-or-pay credits since

                                 Lecember 311 1990. Therefore1 Tenneco

                                 asserts that maintaining this requirement

                                 serves no purpose.

                                 Tenneco states that ltem No. 32 requires

                                 pipelines to identify the location of the


                                 producing fflelds from which gas

                                 requested to be transported for an

                                 aMliate originates. Tenneco argues that

                                 with the implementation of fflexible

                                 receipt and delivery points and capacity

                                 release1 this information becomes useless.

                                 Tenneco contends that shippers will be

                                 using secondary receipt points on their

                                 own contracts and acquiring each other:s

                                 capacity much more than they have

                                 historically. Tenneco asserts that this is

                                 precisely the outcome that the

                                 Commission is trying to bring about by


                                 mandating fflexible receipt and delivery

                                 points and capacity release. Tenneco

                                 submits that with this increase in the

                                 number of transportation transactions

                                 that involve the use of points other than

                                 the primary receipt or delivery point of

                                 the entity requesting transportation1

                                 requiring pipelines to report this

                                information serves no purpose.

                                 Tenneco states that hecord No. 3


                                 requires pipelines to report requested

                                 receipt and delivery points for

                                 transportation requests of their

                                 maryeting aMliates. Tenneco asserts that

                                 the advent of fflexible receipt and delivery

                                 points renders this information useless.

                                 Tenneco argues that the maryeting

                                 aMliate1 liye any other shipper1 will have

                                 the fflrm right to use any receipt or

                                 delivery point on the system to the

                                 extent that capacity is available. Thus1

                                 Tenneco contends the utility of

                                 maintaining a list of requested receipt


                                 and delivery points is vastly diminished.

                                 because the information required by

                                 ltem Nos. 11 W1 231 241 and 32 of

                                 Schedule 2 and all of Schedule 3 will no

                                longer have value after full compliance

                                 with Order No. 0301 Tenneco requests

                                 that the Commission clarify that this

                                information need not be maintained on
                                  .

                                 eliminating the requirement to report it

                                ls consistent with the Commission:s goal.

          action on this issue as plpelines are

          currently setting up their Ebbs1 and a

           2. Commission huling

          The Commission denies the lndicated
          parties: and Nadson:s requests for

          rehearing. Their arguments lose sight of
          the fact that the Form 392 information

          must still be provided electronically1 thus
           allowlng interested parties and the.

           Commission staff to monitor the
           activities of pipelines and their aMliates

           and to initiate the appropriate action
          when evidence of discrimination in favor

          of aMliates exists. The lndicated parties:
          concerns about obtaining reliable and

           accurate Form 392 information are
          unfounded. Section 230.10(g)(2) states

          that:

          An interstate pipeline must provide
           24-hour access1 by electronic means1 to

          the data speciffled in paragraph (b)(2) of
          this section. Access to the information

          must be provided once the service has
          begun. A pipeline must1 on a daily basis1

          either update the information or indicate
          that no changes have occurred in the log

          information.
          Most pipelines satisffled this requirement

          through the use of Ebbs in the past1 and
           Order No. 030 now mandates Ebbs.

          lnterested parties have been receiving
           and will continue to receive the Form 392

          information electronically. Thus1 the
          lndicated parties: argument that the

           Commission and the industry have no
          experience with Ebbs is inaccurate.

          Moreover1 the requirements of Order No.
           030 ensure that each pipeline:s Order No.

          491 Ebb must provide for: (a)
          Lownloading by users; (b) daily bacy-up

          of information1 which must be available
          for at least three years; (c) purging

          information on completed transactions
          from current fflles; (d) display of most

          recent entries ahead of information
          posted earlier; and (e) on-line help1 a

          search function and a menu that permits
          users to separately access records in the

          transportation log and standards of
          conduct information. 22 These features

           allow shippers to taye the information
          that is currently fflled on Form 392s off

          the pipelines: Ebbs and obtain access to
          the information up to three years after it
           .
          ls posted. 23 ln these circumstances1 the
          burden on the pipelines from fflling Form





                                392s and the administrative burden on

                                the Commission from collecting them
                                outweighs any benefflts of collecting the

                                data in hard copy.
                                1 2 The Commission also does not

                                believe that Nadson:s argument relying
                                on 1W U.S.C. 1001 is a valid reason for

                                maintaining the Form 392 fflling
                                requirement. Section 1001 states:

                                Whoever1 in any matter within the
                               durisdiction of any department or agency
                                                               .
                                of the United States ynowlngly and
                                willfully falsiffles1 conceals or covers up by

                                any tricy1 scheme1 or device a material
                                fact1 or mayes any false1 fflctitious or

                                fraudulent statements or representations1
                                or mayes or uses any false writing or
                                                  .
                                document ynowlng the same to contain
                                false1 fflctitious or fraudulent statement or

                                entry1 shall be fflned not more than
                                t101000 or imprisoned not more than fflve

                                years1 or both.
                                Nadson:s argument implies that because

                                a hard copy of the Form 392 information
                                will not be fflled with the Commission
                                                      .
                                pipelines will ynowlngly provide
                                inaccurate or incorrect information

                                through electronic means. The
                                Commission believes that the language of

                                the statute is broad enough to cover
                                electronic postings. Nowever1 in order to
                                prevent any such fraudulent conduct1 the

                                Commission deems the electronic posting
                                of the Form 392 information equivalent

                                to a fflling for purposes of 1W U.S.C. 1001.

                                Since contemporaneously with this order
                                the Commission is issuing a Notice of

                                proposed hulemaying (NOph) which
                                proposes to revise Order No. 491:s
                                reporting requirements1 including Form

                                3921 the Commission will not address
                                Tenneco:s request to delete certain parts

                                of Form 392.

                                C. Application of Order No. 491 to
                                Okary

                                1. hequest for hehearing
                                Okary asserts that the Commission:s

                                order on remand ignores the court:s
                                instructions requiring the Commission to

                                consider the effect of Okary:s evidence on

                                   122 1S CFR 2S4.S(b)(4) and 2S4.9(b)(4).

                                   223 1S CFR 2S4.S(b)(4) and 2S4.9(b)(4).





          the question of control. Okary contends

          that it simply relies upon an equally

          defflcient rationale for concluding1

          without reference to any evidence1 that

          Tennessee Okary and Okary pipeline

           Corporation each1 individually1

           44controls:: Okary1 thereby maying the

          maryeting aMliates of those partners

          maryeting aMliates of Okary. Okary


          submits that to avoid problems inherent

          in fflnding that these partners can

          exercise 44aMrmative control:: over Okary1

          the Commission concluded that they can

          exercise 44negative control:: by simply

          withholding their vote and vetoing any

          transportation transaction that would

          compete with their respective maryeting

           aMliates.

          Okary argues that the ability to withhold

          a vote or 44veto:: any particular
          transaction does not exist as far as open

          access transportation arrangements are
          concerned. Okary states that open access

          pipelines1 including Okary1 are required
          by yy2W4.W(b) and 2W4.9(b) to transport

          natural gas on an open and
          non-discriminatory basis. Okary asserts

          that it is clearly prohibited from taying
          actions that would unduly prefer the
          maryeting aMliates of Okary:s partners

          and Okary:s partners have an obligation
          to the partnership to operate the pipeline

          within legal parameters.

          Okary submits that its
          Commission-approved fflrm and

          interruptible rate schedules establish the
          criteria which control who receives

          transportation service from Okary.
          Okary contends that decisions as to who

          will be permitted to ship on Okary may
          not be made at the whim of a particular

          Okary partner. Okary asserts that if the
          tariff criteria are met1 the request must

          be granted. Okary states that1 in fact1 at
          a Management Committee meeting held
          on 'une 201 19911 Okary:s Management

          Committee1 consisting of representatives
          of each of the partners1 voted

          unanimously to approve a resolution
          authoriking the president of Okary or his

          designee to execute interruptible
          transportation agreements on behalf of

          Okary. Thus1 Okary contends1 each of
          the partners ceded to the Operator the

          authority to enter into interruptible
          transportation agreements. Okary argues

          that no partnership vote is required and
          the Operator is bound by the tariff.

          Okary asserts that it should be obvious
          that not only are Tennessee Okary and

          Okary pipeline Corporation not free to
          veto transportation transactions but each

          has relinquished any right it might
          otherwise have to vote on such

          transactions.
          Okary submits that the record before the

          Commission shows an absence of control.
          Okary asserts that the record before the

          Commission shows a complete absence of
          any vetoing of any transportation

          transaction by any Okary partner1
          consistent with the delegation of





                                authority to enter into such

                                transportation agreements. Okary argues
                                that the Operator is required to act in

                                accordance with its fflduciary
                                responsibilities to the partnership1 not

                                inconsistent with those responsibilities.
                                Okary contends that the Commission:s

                                fflnding here that one partner could prefer
                                its maryeting aMliate by vetoing

                                transportation for others is directly
                                contrary to the Commission:s prior

                                fflndings in this case that 44St]here are no
                                facts before us in this proceeding which

                                indicate that Okary has discriminated in
                                offering transportation services to any

                                party.:: 24
                                1 Okary submits that previously the

                                Commission assumed that the Okary
                                partners would act together to provide

                                preferences to maryeting aMliates of one
                                of the partners or that one of the Okary

                                partners would be willing to grant
                                preferences to their Okary partners in the

                                hopes of obtaining reciprocal preferences.
                                Okary states that here the Commission

                                assumes that one of the partners will
                                simply veto transactions that would

                                benefflt the partnership because the
                                transaction might compete with a

                                transaction of one of its aMliates. Okary
                                asserts that there is no evidence to

                                support any such assumption. Okary
                                contends that to maye such a fflnding the

                                Commission would have to assume that
                                Okary would violate its tariff1 the

                                Commission:s regulations1 and Texas
                                partnership law. Okary argues that the

                                Commission would also have to assume
                                that its prior fflnding that there are no
                                            .
                                facts showlng discrimination in Okary:s

                                offering of transportation is wrong.
                                Okary submits that not one of these

                                assumptions is logical1 consistent with
                                any information relating to Okary1 or

                                supported by evidence in the record.
                                Okary asserts that all of the evidence

                                shows that such control does not exist
                                including the fact that numerous

                                transportation transactions have been
                                conducted by Okary for independent

                                maryeters which compete with the
                                maryeting aMliates of Okary partners.

           Okary states that its decisions as to who
           .
          lt will ship for are subdect to review by
          this Commission and this Commission:s

          complaint procedures. Okary contends
          that if the Commission were to fflnd that

           Okary had engaged in such conduct1
          enforcement proceedings would

          commence and Okary would either be
          ordered to provide the service required or

          its blanyet certifflcate would be revoyed.
          Finally1 Okary argues that it does not

          control any of its individual partners1 is
          not controlled by any of its individual

          partners1 and is not under common
          control with any of its individual

          partners. lt asserts that nothing in the
          record before the Commission suggests

          the contrary.
           Okary also contends that the Commission

          erred to the extent that it relied on the
          modiffled defflnition of 44control.:: Okary

          states that in Order No. 491-A the
           Commission modiffled the defflnition of

           44control:: in y101.2. Okary states that on
          'anuary 101 19901 it sought rehearing of

           Order No. 491-A. Okary states that the
           Commission issued an order granting

          rehearing for purpose of further

          consideration but the Commission has
          never1 to the best of Okary:s ynowledge1
          issued an order on the merits of Okary:s

          rehearing request. Okary states that

          three years have passed and numerous
          orders utiliking the defflnition have issued1

          including the order in this proceeding1
           and it considers its request for rehearing

           as having been denied. Nowever1 to the
          extent that the Commission is applying

          the revised defflnition to support the
          result here1 Okary seeys rehearing.

           Okary asserts that the Commission:s

           order is not at all clear whether it is

           relying upon the modiffled defflnition of
           44control:: to support its decision here. lf

           the Commission:s decision rests at all on.
           44whether acting alone or in con3unction

           with others:: language1 Okary submits
           that the Commission:s decision is in

           error. Okary argues that the effect of the
           additional language is to establish

           44control:: in a 1y0 voting interest owner
           of a corporation. Okary asserts that the

           language creates an irrebuttable
           presumption of 44control:: by anyone

           holding at least a 1Oy0 voting interest in
           a corporation1 contrary to the clear

           statement in the balance of the
           regulation that the presumption of

           control is rebuttable. Okary contends

           these two effects result from the
           indisputable fact that any interest holder

           must act with the requisite plurality in
           order for any particular action to be

           tayen by a corporation or a partnership.
           Okary states that in its case unanimity is

           required for most actions so all partners
           must vote in the aMrmative in order for

           particular action to be tayen. Okary
           asserts that the fact that unanimity is
                           .
           required1 agaln1 does not constitute
           control but1 rather1 evidences a lacy of

           control. Accordingly1 Okary submits that
           the modiffled defflnition is inconsistent

           with the existence of a rebuttable
           presumption1 ls arbitrary and capricious1.

           and lacys any basis in reasoned
           decisionmaying.

           2. Commission huling

           The Commission redects Okary:s request

           for rehearing. Okary argues that the
           Commission:s defflnition of 44control:: is

           inconsistent with the existence of a
           rebuttable presumption. We disagree.

           Section 101.2 states that 44control
           (including the terms 4controllingl:

           4controlled byl: and 4under common
           control with:) includes1 but is not limited

           to1 the possession1 directly or indirectly
           and whether acting alone or in
               .
           con3unction with others1 of the authority
           to direct or cause the direction of the

           management or policies of a company. A
           voting interest of 10 percent or more

           creates a rebuttable presumption of





                               control.:: 23 ln Order No. 491-A1 the
                               Commission specifflcally addressed the

                               issue ofdoint venture pipelines and stated
                               that overlapplng interests create an.

                               incentive to grant an aMliate preference.

                               20 The Commission applied the
                               defflnition in section 101.2 to several

                               pipelines that had requested rehearing1
                               including Nigh lsland Offshore System1

                               U-T Offshore System1 Trailblaker
                               pipeline Company1 Sea hobin pipeline

                               Company1 Northern border pipeline
                               Company and Oreat Layes Oas

                               Transmission Company. 21 ln Tenneco1

                               the court upheld the defflnition of control.
                               and the way ln which the Commission

                               applied it to Northern border pipeline
                               Company. ln considering Okary:s

                               petition for review1 the court remanded
                               the Commission:s application of the term

                                44control:: but not the defflnition of the
                               term. Thus1 Okary:s request for review of

                               the defflnition of control is a collateral

                               attacy on Order No. 491-A and the
                               Commission redects it.

                               1 2 3 To consider whether there is control
                               here1 we will review all the evidence

                               Okary has submitted on the issue. On
                               March 101 19W11 Okary fflled an

                               application under section 1 of the
                               Natural Oas Act for a certifflcate of

                               public convenience and necessity. ln that

                               application1 Okary stated that it is a
                               partnership and submitted its

                               partnership agreement1 which shows that
                               Okary is dointly owned by four partners1

                               2W that the partnership will be managed
                               by a management committee1 which will

                               consist of equal representatives from each
                               partner1 and will be operated by OpOC.

                               ln addition1 OpOC selects the president

                               of Okary1 who also acts as the CEO and
                               the Chairman of the management

                               committee. On 'uly 31 19WW1 Okary
                               emphasiked that its Oeneral partnership

                               agreement speciffles that no action may
                               be tayen by the management committee

                               except by unanimous approval. On
                               'anuary 31 19931 Okary presented1 for the


                                   125 1S CFR 1dl.2.

                                   22d Order No. 49r-A at 311593.

          fflrst time1 a partial copy of a corporate

          resolution dated 'une 201 1991. This
          states that 44the president of Okary or his

          designee is hereby authoriked to execute
          interruptible transportation agreements

          on behalf of Okary.:: because Okary:s

          partners ceded to the president the
          authority to enter into interruptible

          transportation agreements1 no
          partnership vote is required. All of
                                     .
          Okary:s fflrm capacity ls committed to

          Tennessee Oas pipeline Company and
          Columbia Oas Transmission Corporation.

          Therefore1 Okary claims that its partners
          cannot 44control:: transportation either

          aMrmatively or negatively through veto

          power.
          4 We disagree. The partners still have

          authority to direct the management and
          policies of Okary and could1 at any tlme1   .

          revoye the authority over interruptible

          transportation from the president.
          Moreover1 under the terms of the

          partnership agreement1 OpOC selects
          the president of Okary and operates

          Okary. OpOC:s maryeting aMliates ship

          on Okary. OpOC has the requisite
          control described in section 101.2 of the

          Commission:s regulations because it
          operates Okary and1 through the
                                                   .
          president it selects1 manages the plpeline.

           ln addition1 44control:: is not limited to

           authority over fflrm or interruptible

           transportation. lnformal actions of the

           management committee or the partners

           could provide the maryeting aMliates

           with signifflcant advantages1 such as

           non-public transportation information.

           For example1 if Okary intends to build a

           new plpeline under part 2W4 of the.

           Commission:s regulations1 the partners


           could convey that information to their

           maryeting aMliates1 and the maryeting

           aMliates would have an advantage over

           nonaMliated maryeters in obtaining

           customers. Liyewise1 information with

           respect to the addition of new receipt of

           delivery points could be of signifflcant

           advantage to the maryeting aMliates.


           Okary also states that it has not

           discriminated in the past and that no

           Okary partner has vetoed any

           transportation transactions. Okary

           asserts that its operating structure

           together with its history should serve to

           successfully rebut a presumption of

           control. but the partners: ability to

           control the management and policies of

           the pipeline is not linyed to whether

           Okary has discriminated in the past. ln

           Order No. 4911 the Commission found


           suMcient anticompetitive conduct

          industry-wide to substantiate the need

          for the rule. The court upheld the rule in

           Tenneco. The Commission need not

           produce evidence of discrimination with

           respect to each pipeline to 3.ustify

           application of the rule to any one

           pipeline.


           Finally1 Okary argues that it is sub3.ect to

           the undue discrimination provisions of

           section 4 of the NOA and therefore will

           not discriminate in favor of its aMliates.

           29 Lespite these prohibitions1 the

           Commission found the need for

           additional guidelines to deter

           anticompetitive conduct and concluded
           .
          ln Order No. 491 that standards of

           conduct and reporting requirements were

           appropriate. 30 Okary:s argument that it

           should not be sub3.ect to Order No. 491

           because it is sub3.ect to other regulations


          is inconsistent with the purposes of

           Order No. 491.

                                Nadson asserts that the Commission:s

                                procedures for acting on yy101.3(d) and
                                2W4.2WO(e) ffllings are illegal. Nadson

                                states that the Commission treats these
                                ffllings as non-tariff ffllings which are

                                assigned an MO docyet prefflx. Nadson
                                states that according to y101.3(d) the

                                ffllings are made to enable shippers and
                                the Commission to determine how the

                                pipeline is complying with the
                                substantive standards of conduct.

                                Nadson submits that the ffllings cannot
                                achieve this purpose1 however1 since they

                                are withheld from public notice in the
                                Federal hegister and in the Commission:s

                                daily orders. Nadson contends that they
                                are effectively concealed from public view

                                in the great madority of cases since
                                shippers and other interested members of
                                                                     .
                                the public have no way of ynowlng when

                                Nadson states that1 moreover1 the
                                Commission has ruled that the MO

                                ffllings are non-adversarial and that the
                                Commission may therefore rely upon

                                non-public and off-the-record
                                communications in determining whether

                                a pipeline is in compliance with the
                                substantive standards or not. 31 Nadson

                                states that the Commission has further
                                ruled that no one may protest or

                                intervene in the non-public proceedings.
                                Nadson states that any attempt to assert
                                that a compliance fflling ls not in.

                                compliance with the law will be
                                redocyeted in a new proceeding and

                                treated as a complaint in which the
                                erstwhile protestant bears the burden of

                                conducting discovery to prove that a
                                pipeline:s compliance fflling ls not in.

                                compliance with the law1 rather than the

          3 4 Nadson argues that similar problems

          taint the ffllings under section 2W4.2W0
          since Order No. 030 appears to generally

          incorporate the existing procedures and
          relies upon them to support the effective

          deregulation of the unbundled pipeline
          merchants under the Subpart '

          certifflcates. Nadson states that the basis
          for this conclusion is that Order No. 030

           appears to maintain the dichotomy
          between tariff provisions (which

          presumably would be made in an MT or
          successor docyet) and procedures (which
          fflling requirement1 the Commission

          states1 would be similar to that of

           y101.3(d)). 33 Nadson asserts that the
          primary difference between the new and
          the current procedures1 and the only

           apparent reason for not incorporating
           y101.3(d) along with the various other

          sections which were incorporated by
          reference1 is that the new rules have

          deleted the statement that the fflling will
          enable shippers and the Commission to

          determine how a pipeline is complying
          with the standards of conduct.

           3 Nadson contends that the deletion of
          the phrase is apparently not accidental

          since it accurately refflects the fact that
          the new fflling will not enable shippers or

           any other member of the public to (l)
          learn how a given pipeline defflnes

           44operating employee:: or how it
          interprets the phrase 44practicablel:: (2)

          receive notice of any such fflling1 (3) have
           an opportunity to comment thereon1 or

           (4) obtain a decision based upon public
          evidence compiled in a public record in

           accordance with applicable law.
          Nadson states that faced with the

           Commission:s determination to leave the
          defflnitional diMculties to be resolved in

          the individual restructuring docyets1 it
          did not seey dudicial review of Order No.

                                Nadson asserts that the issue here is
                                whether the Commission may rely upon

                                what Nadson calls the stealth procedures
                                of section 101.3(d) for purposes of maying

                                requirement. For the reason set forth
                                above1 Nadson submits that the

                                Commission cannot do so.

          2. Commission huling

          The Commission redects Nadson:s
          argument that its procedures for acting

          on y101.3(d) and y2W4.2WO(e) ffllings
          prohibit public participation. Nadson

          misinterprets y2W4.2WO(e). lt requires
          pipelines to fflle procedures for complying

          with standards of conduct as part of their
          publicly noticed compliance ffllings. 34

          Any interested person can participate in
          those proceedings and protest pipelines:

          proposals for complying with the
          standards. All the plpelines: compliance.

          ffllings have been publicly available and
          Nadson1 as well as other interested

          persons1 have had ample opportunity to
          comment on those procedures. ln fact1

          Nadson intervened in 91 restructuring
          proceedings and fflled comments with

          respect to several pipelines: standards of
          conduct. 33 Contrary to Nadson:s claims

          of 44stealthl:: the Commission:s decisions
          with respect to the standards of conduct

          will be reviewed in the context of the
          restructuring proceedings.

           1 2 The public also participated in the
          proceedings in which the Commission

          reviewed the standards of conduct
          plpelines had fflled before Order No. 030.

          required restructuring. Although the
          Commission labeled these proceedings as

           44non-adversariall:: 30 and invited the
          public to fflle complaints1 31 it also

          addressed all requests for rehearing of
          the May 1991 standards of conduct

          decisions (these docyets have the prefflx
          MO). 3W Eight parties sought rehearing

          of the May 1991 MO orders. 39 Of those1
          lOM asyed the Commission to address

          its previous protests. 40 ln the Order on
          hehearing1 the Commission individually

          addressed each of lOM:s previous
          allegations concerning pipelines:

          implementation of the standards. 41
          Nadson had the same opportunity to fflle

          comments and protests in the pipelines:
          pre-Order No. 030 standards of conduct

           (MO) proceedings and did not.

                                3 4 3 d T S Finally1 Nadson incorrectly

                                states that the Commission treated the

                                MO ffllings as non-public. These ffllings
                                are public and are available through the

                                Commission:s hecords lnformation and
                                Management System. ln addition1 all

                                conversations that occurred between the
                                Commission staff and pipelines were

                                memorialiked in memoranda that were
                                placed in the Commission:s public fflles.

                                42 The public had an opportunity to
                                raise issues concerning those

                                conversations during rehearing of the
                                May 1991 orders.

                                9 Therefore1 not only are the MO ffllings

                                public1 but contrary to Nadson:s
                                assertions1 they have no real relation to

                                our decision to eliminate the requirement
                                to fflle Form 392s. The MO docyets

                                concern the pipelines: general
                                implementation of the standards of

                                conduct. ln contrast1 Form 392 is a log of
                                specifflc transportation transactions. As

                                stated1 we are eliminating the

                                requirements to fflle Form 392s because
                                the information contained in them will

                                be available on pipelines: Ebbs. 43
                                10 Nowever1 the Commission does agree

           E. lnterpretation of 44Operating
           Employee::

           ln response to questions raised by
           Nadson and other companies and in order

           to assist pipelines in their compliance
           with the separation of operating

           personnel as required by Standard O and
           the reporting requirements of y230.10(b)1

           the Commission will clarify what type of
           employee it considers an 44operating

           employee.::
           Standard O1 1W CFh 101.3(g)1 states that

           44St]o the maximum extent practicable a
           Spipeline:s] operating employees and the

           operating employees of its maryeting
           aMliate must function independently of
           each other.:: ln addition1 under the

          While not mandating organikational

          separation1 Standard O ensures against

          aMliate preference and the discriminatory

          dissemination of information by requiring

          a pipeline to provide1 to the maximum

          extent practicable1 for the independent

          functioning of 44operating personnel:: of

          the pipeline and its maryeting aMliate.

          The contemporaneous disclosure


          mandate of Standard F requires that to

          the extent a pipeline provides to a

          maryeting aMliate any information

          related to transportation of natural gas1
          .
          lt must provide that information

          contemporaneously to all potential

          shippers1 aMliated and nonaMliated1 on

          its system. Standard O:s requirement

          that operating employees are to function

          independently to the maximum extent

          practicable will help ensure that the

          opportunity to share such information is

          minimiked. lf1 for example1 a pipeline


          and its maryeting aMliate could evade

          the contemporaneous disclosure

          requirement simply by using the same

          person to arrange transportation on the

          pipeline and maryet gas for the aMliate1

          the rule would be substantially

          undermined.

          Throughout the rulemaying proceeding1

          however1 the Commission has held that


          complete divestment1 divorcement1 or

          organikational separation of pipelines

          and their maryeting aMliates is not

          necessary to prevent the abuses at which

          the maryeting aMliates rule is aimed.

          The independent functioning requirement

          does not require a pipeline to separate all

          of its employees from those of a

          maryeting aMliate1 but rather only

          operating employees. This determination
          .
          ls consistent with the Commission:s

          fflnding that complete organikational

          separation is unnecessary and may even


          be harmful where divestment chills

          essential day-to-day communications

          between the pipeline and its aMliate.

          The Commission stated in Order No.

          491-A that the phrase 444operating

          employees: can include oMcers1 directors

          and managers as well as non-management

          employees.:: 44 Nowever1 without further


          clarifflcation of that phrase1 pipelines may

          not be able to identify properly every





                                 44operating employeel:: especially those

                                shared with their aMliate. Since different
                                  .
                                plpelines are faced with different

                                practical circumstances1 a person:s status

                                 as an 44operating employee:: will1 in many

                                situations1 depend not on his or her

                                occupation or title1 but on his or her

          F. Extension of heporting hequirements
          Finally1 the Commission will only extend

          the sunset date of Order No. 491:s
          reporting requirements from Lecember

          311 19931 until 'une 301 19941 because
          contemporaneously with this order the

          Commission is issuing a NOph in Locyet
          No. hM94-O-000 which1 among other

          things1 substantially revises Order No.
          491:s reporting requirements. The

          Commission believes that extending the
          sunset provision to 'une 301 19941 will
          allow the Commission enough time to

          issue a fflnal rule setting forth the new
          reporting requirements and will also

          prevent any gaps in the reporting
          requirements which would occur if the

          Commission simply let the sunset
          provision lapse.

          V. lnformation Collection Statement
          OMce of Management and budget

          (OMb) regulations require approval of
          certain information collection

          requirements imposed by agency rules.
          43 The subdect order does not establish

          any new information collection
          requirements and does not reduce the

          reporting requirements under FEhC-3921

          'une 301 1994. The 1WO-day extension of

                                Section 2.01 subparagraph (a)(l)1 is

                                revised to addust the fee authoriked by
                                the Trademary (Lanham) Act of 1940 in

                                accordance with the provisions of public
                                Law 103-119.





          Other Considerations
          This rule change is in conformity with

          the requirements of Executive Order
          120121 and the paperwory heduction Act
          of 19W01 44 U.S.C. 33011 et seq. There

          are no information collection
          requirements relating to patent and

          trademary fee rules.
          This regulation was reviewed by the

          OMce of lnformation and hegulatory
          Affairs of the OMce of Management and
          budget under Executive Order 12W00.

          The pTO has determined that this rule
          change has no Federalism implications

          affecting the relationship between the
          National Oovernment and the States as

          outlined in Executive Order 12012.
          Notice and opportunity for comment are

          unnecessary under 3 U.S.C. 333(O)(b)
          because this rule change merely restates
          a Congressionally-mandated fee change.
                                                        .
          because notice of proposed rulemaying ls
          not required for this rule1 the hegulatory

          Flexibility Act (3 U.S.C. 001 et seq. )
          does not apply.

          The pTO published a notice of proposed
          rulemaying on 'uly 211 19931 (3W Fh
          39102) to increase the trademary fee to

          t243 based on pending legislation that
          would have given pTO the authority to

          raise trademary fees in excess of the
          Consumer price lndex. The legislation as

          passed (pub. L. 103-119) simply
          increased the trademary application
          fflling fee to t243 effective the date of

          enactment.

          ll. Undue Economic Nardship

          A. Comments
          Several comments requested that FLA

          extend the date that the nutrition
          labeling and nutrient content claim
          provisions of the act will be applied to





                               dietary supplements. Most comments

                               requested an additional year1 for a total
                               compliance period of 1W months. One
                               comment proposed a delay of at least 9

                               months. The comments reported many
                               examples of the diMculties in meeting a

                               0-month compliance period. Several
                               comments stated that the amount of

                               time needed to redesign labels would far
                               exceed the resources available. One

                               comment reported that the insuMcient
                               time allowed to revise labels would result
                               .
                               ln some products being removed from the
                               maryet temporarily while new labels are

                               being prepared. An additional comment
                               requested the extension because of the

                               diMculties in the logistics of revising
                               existing labels1 printing1 pacyaging1 and
                               exhausting existing label supplies with a

                               short compliance period.

                               Other comments that requested a delay
                               cited the savings that could be gained

                               with insignifflcant loss of benefflts. One
                               comment reported that inventory
                               disposal could be reduced by W3 percent

                               with an 1W-month compliance period.
                               Another comment stated that FLA:s

                               cost estimate of t20 million represents 1
                               percent of industry sales but a much

                               larger percentage of industry profflts. The
                               comment explained that extending the

                               compliance period would reduce the costs
                               of compliance and1 therefore1 minimike

                               any reduction in profflts.
                               One comment requested a delay because

                               there will be additional costs for
                               compliance with the upcoming United

                               States pharmacopoeia (USp) standards.
                               The comment stated that resources could

                               be better spent if these compliance
                               efforts were completed concurrently

                               rather than consecutively.
                               One comment requested a delay because

                               of the overlap with the fflnal months of
                               the extended period that was allowed for

                               foods in conventional food form. The
                               comment reported that many

                               conventional food manufacturers and
                               their label suppliers are rushing to
                               produce fflnal labels for such foods. The

                               comment said that supplement
                               manufacturers will not be able to secure

                               revised labels for their products from
                               label manufacturers in time to meet a





          0-month deadline because of the
          competition for label manufacturers:

          resources.
          The agency agrees that it will be diMcult

          for dietary supplement manufacturers to
          comply within 0 months1 especially ln     .

          light of the fact that label suppliers are
          currently stressed with label orders from

          manufacturers of food in conventional.
          food form who are attemptlng to meet
          the May 1994 deadline for complying

          with the 1990 amendments. The agency
          also agrees that an extension of the date

          of application would result in signifflcant
          savings for the industry. Administrative

          costs1 printing costs1 and label inventory
          disposal costs are all dependent on the

          length of the compliance period. The
          agency has determined that the costs of
          the regulations could be reduced with an

          extension.
          The agency made a determination in the

          date of application fflnal rule that the
          1990 amendments will result in an undue

          economic hardship on manufacturers of
          food products in conventional food form

          (3W Fh 2010 at 2013). The agency notes
          that the costs of compliance for

          manufacturers of foods in conventional
          food form represent less than 1 percent

          of sales. The costs of compliance with a
          0-month compliance period for dietary
          supplements is approximately 2 percent

          of sales. Therefore1 if the agency does
          not extend the date of application for

          dietary supplement manufacturers1 that
          segment of the food industry will be

          asyed to bear higher relative costs than
          the agency determined were reasonable

          for foods in conventional food form.
          For all these reasons1 the agency

          determines that the congressionally
          mandated date of application will result
          ln an undue economic hardship for.

          dietary supplement manufacturers.
          b. The Agency:s Letermination of a

          Late of Application of Section 403(q)
          and (r)(2) of the Act as Applied to

          Lietary Supplements
          The agency has determined that undue

          economic hardship will result if the
          dietary supplement industry ls required.

          to comply with section 403(q) and (r) of
          the act within 0 months. As will be





                               shown in the following discussion on the
                               economic impact1 a 0-month delay (total

                               of 12 months to comply) in the
                               application of section 403(q) and (r)(2)
                               to dietary supplements would result in

                               over 40 percent savings of compliance
                               cost1 and a 12-month delay (total of 1W

                               months to comply) would result in over
                               30 percent savings. Oiven the large
                               disparity in costs of compliance for

                               manufacturers of dietary supplements if
                               they are required to comply in 0 months1

                               as compared to those that are being
                               borne by manufacturers of food in

                               conventional form1 FLA fflnds that it
                               should tailor the delay to reduce the costs
                               for dietary supplement manufacturers

                               and thus to minimike the disparity.
                               Therefore1 the agency concludes that it is

                               appropriate to delay the application date
                               for dietary supplements for 12 months1 as

                               it did for foods in conventional food
                               form. Thus1 the agency intends to apply
                               section 403(q) and (r)(2) to foods labeled

                               after 'uly 11 1993. The agency fully
                               expects that some dietary supplement

                               fflrms will be able to comply before this
                               date once the pressure on printing labels
                               for foods in conventional food form is

                               eased after May W1 1994. Therefore1
                               consumers can expect to begin endoying

                               the health benefflts of the label changes
                               prior to 'uly 11 1993.

                               Some comments agreed with the agency:s

                               estimates of the costs of relabeling.
                               Many comments were directed at issues

                               covered by the advance notice of
                               proposed rulemaying (ANphM)1 which
                               addressed the safe use of dietary

                               supplements (3W Fh 330901 'une 1W1
                               1993). Several comments stated that the

                               three proposals that the agency issued
                               (there was a proposed rule on health

                               claims (3W Fh 33100 in addition to the
                               proposals on nutrition labeling and
                               nutrient content claims)) and the

                               ANphM should be considered one
                               proposal. These comments stated that

                               the economic impact of the four
                               documents would exceed t100 million

                               and would be considered a mador rule
                               under Executive Order 12291.

          some of these types of dietary

          supplement products may be subdect to
          the nutrition labeling provisions.

          Nowever1 because many of these products
          do not contain signifflcant amounts of

          nutrients1 many manufacturers will not
          be faced with the necessity of relabeling

          their products. For these reasons1 the
          agency believes that its estimate of the

          number of fflrms may be low1 but that to
          include all herbal products

          manufacturers and manufacturers of
          other similar nutritional substances

          would infflate the estimate. Nowever1 the
          agency has no basis on which to arrive at

          the actual number of fflrms. Therefore1 in..
          its fflnal analysls1 the agency ls estimating

          the total number of fflrms affected to be
          between 130 and 300.

          b. Costs
          3. Several comments disagreed with the

          agency:s estimate of administrative costs.
          The comments stated that actual

          administrative expenses would be at least
          t11000 per label. Administrative

          expenses1 according to the comments1 are
          associated with the creation or redesign1

          proofreading1 legal review1 pricing1 bid
          review1 and retraining of customer service

          and sales staff. One comment estimates
          that administrative costs to one fflrm

          would be W0 to 120 hours of executive
          time1 or approximately t21300 to t31130.

          FLA recognikes that the factors that
          determine administrative costs are very

          complicated. The agency:s estimates of
          administrative costs are based on a

          compliance cost model for food labeling
          created for FLA by hesearch Triangle

          lnstitute (hTl) (hef. 1). According to
          hTl1 many fflrms estimate that

          administrative effort would be twice as
          high for a 0-month compliance period as

          for a 12-month compliance period. ln the
          dietary supplement proposals1 FLA

          estimated that for a 0-month compliance
          period1 manufacturers of dietary

          supplements will incur administrative
          costs of tW30 per fflrm. The range of

          administrative cost estimates submitted
          in the comments was broad and there

          were no identifflable patterns to the
          estimates given. Although FLA

          acynowledges that its assumptions may





                                have resulted in underestimates1 the

                                comments did not provide enough
                                detailed information to permit FLA to
                                evaluate the administrative cost

                                estimates that they submitted.
                                Therefore1 the agency ls not altering its.

                                original estimates based on these
                                comments.

                                The agency has determined that total
                                administrative costs for a 0-month

                                compliance period are between t1301000
                                and t23010001 depending on the exact

                                number of fflrms affected by the
                                regulations. As determined by the

                                contractor:s study (hef. 1)1
                                administrative costs are lower with

                                longer compliance periods. A 1-year
                                compliance period results in

                                administrative costs of between t031000
                                and t1231000. An 1W-month compliance

                                period results in administrative costs of
                                between t301000 and t941000.

                                4. One comment stated that the
                                requirement that herbal dietary

                                supplements be required to bear
                                nutrition labeling would mandate that all

                                herbal products be assayed for their
                                nutrient content. The comment further

                                explained that testing for 12 nutrients
                                would cost t3WW per product for a total

                                of t13 million for 231000 products.
                                The agency agrees that to the extent

                                that herbal product manufacturers will
                                provide nutrition labeling1 herbal

                                products will need to be assayed for their
                                nutrient content. The agency notes1
                                however1 that many herbs do not contain

                                signifflcant amounts of the nutrients that
                                must be listed in the nutrition label1 and

                                that this fact is determinable from
                                reference worys without testing. Thus1

                                these herbs will not need to be tested.
                                Many comments admitted that1 in

                                general1 herbal products do not contain
                                signifflcant amounts of nutrients and are

                                not consumed for their nutrient content.
                                Nowever1 some herbal products and

                                combination products will require
                                nutrient testing.

                                ln the proposals1 the agency assumed
                                that dietary supplements of vitamins and

                                minerals will not undergo any additional
                                testing as a result of the nutrition

                                labeling requirements. Comments did





          not obdect to this assumption.
                                            .
          Therefore1 in its fflnal analysls1 the.
           agency ls estimating that as many as

           201000 products may undergo testing
          once every 3 years for a total discounted

           analytical cost over the next 20 years of
           t33 million (1 percent discount rate).

           3. One comment agreed1 and several
          comments disagreed1 with the agency:s

          estimate of label printing and redesign
          costs. The comments that disagreed
          stated that printing and redesign costs

          would be at least tW00 to t11200 per
          label. One comment stated that the cost
                       .
          of redesignlng and printing each label
          would be 2 hours of desytop redesign1

           t20 for linotronic service1 and t000 for
          new plates1 for a total of t130 per label.

           One comment obdected to FLA:s
           assumption that label revisions for

          supplements are less comprehensive than
          revisions for foods in conventional food

          form. The comment states that
          incorporating the 44Nutrition Facts::

          section plus the ingredient list will
          necessitate complete redistribution of

          information on many labels.
          ln the analysls of the proposed rules1 the.

           agency estimated that1 for a 0-month
          compliance period1 printing and redesign

          costs would be approximately t11000 per
          label. The comments do not suggest that

          the agency:s estimate is incorrect.
          Therefore1 the agency:s fflnal analysis of

          printing costs is based on a per label cost
          of t11000 for each of between 131000 and
           131000 labels1 or between t13 million and

           t13 million. According to the hTl study1
          the length of the compliance period

          determines a fflrm:s ability to combine
          planned label changes with mandated

          changes. Therefore1 incremental labeling
           and redesign activities are less costly

          with lengthier compliance periods. lf the
           agency extended the compliance period

          by only 0 months1 printing and redesign
          costs would be between tl.3 million and

           t31.3 million. The 1-year extension that.
          the agency ls providing will reduce

          printing and redesign costs to between t0
          million and t2W million.

           0. Several comments provided data on
          label inventories that would be subdect to

          disposal. These comments stated that a





                               4- to 0-month supply of product labels is
                               common1 resulting in t3.4 million to t3.1

                               million of label inventory that will be
                               discarded. Another comment suggested

                               that its dietary supplement label and box
                               inventory disposal costs would be

                                t3231000 with a 0-month compliance
                               period1 t2001000 with a 1-year

                               compliance period1 and t301000 with an
                                1W-month compliance period. One

                               comment estimated the cost of discarding
                               noncompliant labels would be

                                approximately t301000 for one fflrm.
                               The estimates provided by the comments

                                are in line with the agency:s preliminary
                               estimate of label inventory disposal costs.
                                                          .
                               Therefore1 the agency ls not changing its
                               estimate based on the comments. The
                               cost of label inventory disposal for a

                                0-month compliance period is between t3
                               million and t23 million1 depending on

                               the number of products affected.
                               According to the hTl study and

                               comments1 lengthier compliance periods
                                allow fflrms to use up more existing label

                               supplies1 thus reducing inventory disposal
                               costs. According to data submitted in

                               Analysis document that was published in

                               inventory disposal costs would be
                               between t3 million and t13 million. The

                                1W-month compliance period that the
                                agency ls providing will result in costs of.

                               between t2 million and t9 million.
                                1. Several comments disagreed with the

                                agency:s estimate of the cost of inventory
                               disposal. The comments argued that

                               fflrms would dispose of fflnished product in
                                addition to labels. The comments stated

                               that typical product costs for dietary
                               supplements would result in an inventory

                               value for the disposal of 31000 products
                               of between t4W million and t13 million.
                                One fflrm estimated its own cost of

                               discarding noncompliant inventory would
                               be approximately 30 percent of fflnished

                               goods inventory1 or about t431000.
                               because these proposals cover only the

                               labeling of dietary supplements1 the





          agency does not agree that there would
          be any reason for fflrms to dispose of any

          product inventory. Nor did the
          comments provide an explanation as to

          why it would be necessary to do so.
          Moreover1 any product pacyaged and

          labeled in accordance with law before the
          date that FLA begins to apply the

          section 403(q) and (r) of the act will not
          need to be relabeled. Therefore1 the
                   .
          agency ls not changing its estimate based
          on this comment.

          W. Several comments argued that the
          agency failed to consider the cost of
                                      .
          discarding and redesignlng catalogs1
          product literature1 and advertising. The
          comments suggested that these costs

          would be at least t401000 per fflrm1 or
          t20 million for all fflrms.

          The comments did not provide an
          explanation as to why it would be

          necessary to discard and redesign
          catalogs and product literature. The

          agency does agree that1 to the extent
          that these materials are labeling1 they

          must comply with the nutrient content
          and health claims provisions of the act.

          Nowever1 the agency believes that many
          of the claims made in these types of

          materials are drug claims or
          structure-function claims1 not health

          claims1 and therefore are not subdect to
          these rules. The comments did not
          present evidence to support a different

          fflnding. Consequently1 the agency has no
          basis on which to conclude that extensive

          catalog and product literature redesign
          will be required by these fflnal rules.
                                     .
          Therefore1 the agency ls not changing its
          estimate based on these comments.

          9. Several comments argued that the
          agency failed to consider the cost of

          relabeling of product returned from the
          retailer. The comments stated that it is

          common practice in the supplement
          industry to accept returns from retailers

          in the event of a label change. lndustry
          fflrms would be faced with a number of
          products returned from retailers

          unwilling to carry products with older
          labels. The comments estimated the cost

          of processing returns1 disposing of
          product1 and applying for full credit at

          t4W million.





                               Any product labeled before the
                               applicability date will not need to

                               comply with the new nutrition labeling

                               and nutrient content claim provisions.

                               Therefore1 no product that is labeled in
                               accordance with law before 'uly 11 19931

                               need be returned1 relabeled1 or destroyed

                               as a result of these new provisions.

                               Nowever1 FLA agrees that to the extent

                               that product is returned1 the cost of
                               disposing of product returned from

                               retailers because of 44old:: labeling should

                               be considered a cost of these regulations.
                                                         .
                               Nowever1 the agency ls unpersuaded of
                               the magnitude of the cost and is unsure

                               of the extent to which 44old:: product will

                               be returned. The comments provided

                               insuMcient information with which the

                               agency could estimate these costs.
                               Therefore1 the agency ls not changing its.

                               estimates based on this comment.

                               1O. Several comments expressed concern

                               that the rules may cause the loss of many

                               thousands of3.obs1 the closing of many

                               fflrms1 and the loss of products from the
                               maryetplace. According to one comment1

                               the proposed rules would cause the loss

                               of more than t10 million in sales and as

                               many as 100 3.obs in one company.
                               Another comment stated a belief that 2

                               million Americans will lose their 3.obs as a

                               result of the regulations. The comments

                               did not provide any specifflc information

                               as to how the regulations would cause
                               the loss of3.obs and products.

                               The agency agrees that the inability to

                               maye certain nutrient content or health

                               claims may reduce the maryetability of

                               certain products and perhaps lead to a

                               company:s decision to remove a product
                               from the maryetplace. Nowever1 these

                               rules affect only labeling; they do not

                               require any supplement to be removed

                               from the maryet. Moreover1 the agency
                               does not believe that many products are

                               currently maying health claims1 as

                               distinguished from drug claims or

                               structure-function claims. Therefore1 the

                               agency has no basis to fflnd that these
                               regulations will cause the problems

                               described in these comments. The

                               agency believes that there is every reason

                               to expect that the continued maryeting
                               of the vast ma3.ority of dietary





          supplement products will be unaffected

          by these regulations..
          1l. ln the analysls of the proposed rules1

          the agency recogniked that the rules
          could have an adverse impact on small
          businesses. Most of the costs associated

          with labeling regulations are fflxed costs1
          which are typically more burdensome for

          small fflrms than for large fflrms because
          of the smaller sales base on which to

          spread costs.
          One comment stated that the small

          business exemption was inadequate
          because small fflrms would not be able to

          avoid complying with the regulations
          because of competitive pressure. Another

          comment stated that the proposals would
          be catastrophic to small business owners

          and woryers.
          FLA notes that the Nutrition Labeling

          and Education Act Amendments of 19931
          which were enacted on August 131 19931
          provide relief for small businesses from

          the requirements of section 403(q) of the
          act. The agency believes that the new

          exemption for small businesses will
          signifflcantly mitigate any negative

          impact on small fflrms.
          12. One comment stated that the

          proposed rule regarding health claims
          will cause paln1 suffering1 and death that.

          would not occur were labeling and
          advertising allowed to include health

          claims. The comment was unspecifflc as
          to why these results would occur.

          lf the absence of health claims causes.
          paln1 suffering1 or death1 these

          regulations provide any party with a
          vehicle for submitting data to support a

          particular health claim for agency
          review. Therefore1 the agency does not
          agree with this comment.

          C. benefflts

          13. One comment stated that the
          regulations will provide benefflts by
          preventing consumers from wasting

          money on unnecessary and ineffective
          dietary supplements. Another comment

          stated that if someone wanted to waste a
          little money taying too many vitamins or

          supplements in the hope of avoiding
          serious illness and the need for harsh

          drugs1 they should be allowed to do so.
          because there are sources other than





                                labeling that provide information about

                                the potential uses of dietary supplements1
                                the agency believes that limiting the use

                                of claims on labels or labeling will be of
                                limited effect in preventing consumers

                                from purchasing supplements that they
                                erroneously believe will prevent serious

                                illness. Nowever1 these regulations will
                                ensure that the labels of dietary
                                supplements will provide full nutrition

                                labeling to help consumers to maintain
                                healthy dietary practices1 and they will

                                help to ensure that any nutrient content
                                or health claims made in the labeling of

                                these products are scientifflcally valid1
                                truthful1 and not misleading. For these

                                reasons1 these regulations will provide a
                                signifflcant benefflt.

                                14. Some comments stated that the cost
                                of providing nutrition information on the

                                labels of dietary supplements of herbs
                                would greatly outweigh any clear public

                                benefflt. The comments explained that
                                herbs do not contain signifflcant amounts

                                of the core nutrients and are not
                                normally consumed for their nutritional

                                value. Therefore1 the value to consumers
                                of including nutrition labeling on herb

                                products is insignifflcant.
                                The agency agrees with this comment.

                                Nowever1 the agency notes that those
                                products that do not contain signifflcant

                                amounts of the 14 mandatory nutrients
                                will generally not be required to bear

                                nutrition labeling. Therefore1 although
                                there will be no clear public benefflt1

                                there will also be no cost.

                                FLA has examined the economic
                                implications of the fflnal rules amending

                                on nutrition labeling1 nutrient content
                                claims1 and health claims for dietary

                                Flexibility Act (pub. L. 9O-334).
                                Executive Order 12W00 directs agencies

                                to assess all costs and benefflts of
                                available regulatory alternatives and1

                                The hegulatory Flexibility Act requires





          analyking options for regulatory relief for
          small businesses. FLA fflnds that these

          fflnal rules on dietary supplements1 tayen
          together1 are not signifflcant as defflned by

          Executive Order 12W00. ln accordance
          with the hegulatory Flexibility Act1 the

          agency certiffles that the fflnal rules will
          not have a signifflcant impact on a
          substantial number of small businesses.

          The agency has reviewed the comments
          and has determined that the costs of

          compliance associated with the 1W-month
          compliance period provided by the

          agency include administrative costs of
          between t301000 and t10010001 analytical

          costs of between t0 and t33 million1
          printing and redesign costs of between t0
          and t2W million1 and label inventory

          disposal costs of between t2 and t9
          million. Total discounted costs of the

          fflnal regulations1 tayen together are
          between tW and t00 million (1 percent

          discount rate). lf the agency did not
          extend the application of the rules1 total

          discounted costs would be between t20
          and t133 million for a 0-month
          compliance period1 or between t11 and

          tW4 million for a 1-year compliance
          period.

          lV. Environmental lmpact
          The agency has determined under 21

          CFh 23.24 (a)(11) that this action is of a
          type that does not individually or

          cumulatively have a signifflcant impact on
          the human environment. Therefore1

          neither an environmental impact
          statement is required.

          ln the Federal hegister of 'une 1W1 1993

          (3W Fh 33113)1 FLA published a
          proposed rule entitled 44Food Labeling;

          Oeneral hequirements for Nutrition
          Labeling for Lietary Supplements of

          Vitamins1 Minerals1 Nerbs1 or Other
          Similar Nutritional Substances::
          (hereinafter identiffled as 44the nutrition

          labeling proposal for dietary
          supplements::) to establish regulations on

          the nutrition labeling of dietary
          supplements of vitamins1 minerals1 herbs1
          and other similar nutritional substances.

          A document correcting various editorial
          errors in that proposed rule was

          published in the Federal hegister of 'uly
          211 1993 (3W Fh 40104).
          The proposed rule was issued to





                                implement the 1990 amendments (pub.
                                L. 101-333)1 which were signed into law
                                on November W1 1990. This new law

                                amended the Federal Food1 Lrug1 and
                                Cosmetic Act (the act) in a number of

                                important ways. One of the notable
                                aspects of the 1990 amendments is that
                                lt added section 403(q) to the act (21.

                                U.S.C. 343(q)). This section requires
                                that most foods bear nutrition labeling.

                                ln response to section 403(q) of the act1
                                FLA published a proposed rule on

                                nutrition labeling in the Federal hegister
                                of November 211 1991 (30 Fh 00300 at

                                00393). That document proposed1 among
                                other things1 a regulation specifflcally for
                                the nutrition labeling of dietary

                                supplements of vitamins or minerals
                                (proposed y101.30). lt also proposed to

                                maye the nutrition labeling of dietary
                                supplements of herbs or other similar
                                nutritional substances subdect to y101.9

                                (21 CFh 101.9)1 the general regulation
                                on nutrition labeling. This distinction

                                refflects section 403(q)(3)(F) (formerly
                                section 403(q)(3)(E)) of the act. This
                                section provides that if a food to which

                                section 411 of the act (21 U.S.C. 330)
                                applies (i.e.1 a dietary supplement of

                                vitamins or minerals) contains one or
                                more of the nutrients required to be

                                labeling of such food shall comply with
                                requirements of subparagraph (l) and (2)

                                Sof section 403(q) of the act] in a manner
                                which is appropriate for such food and

                                which is speciffled in regulations of the
                                Secretary.:: Other dietary supplements
                                are not subdect to section 403(q)(3)(F) of

                                the act and thus are subdect to regulation
                                under section 403(q) of the act as any

                                other food.
                                ln response to the proposed rule on

                                nutrition labeling of November 211 19911
                                FLA received over 43 responses1 each

                                containing one or more comments1 that
                                pertained to the nutrition labeling of
                                dietary supplements. The agency

                                summariked and discussed the issues in
                                these comments in the preamble of the

                                mandatory nutrition labeling fflnal rule
                                that it issued on 'anuary 01 1993 (3W Fh
                                2019 at 2101). Nowever1 the regulations

                                that FLA adopted in that fflnal rule





          applied only to the nutrition labeling of
          foods in conventional food form (y101.9).
          They did not apply to dietary

          supplements because of a moratorium
          established by the LS act.

          The LS act (pub. L. 102-311) was signed
          into law on October 01 1992. ln section

          202(a)(l)1 the LS act established a
          moratorium until Lecember 131 19931 on

          the implementation of the 1990
          amendments1 with respect to dietary
          supplements. Thus1 FLA did not fflnalike

          the proposed rules pertaining to the
          nutrition labeling of dietary supplements

          of vitamins and minerals (y101.30) or of
          herbs or other nutritional substances.

          Section 202(a)(2) of the LS act required
          that the Secretary of Nealth and Numan
          Services1 and by delegation FLA1 issue

          new proposed regulations that are
          applicable to dietary supplements no

          later than 'une 131 19931 and fflnal
          regulations by Lecember 311 1993. ln
          response to this provision1 FLA issued

          the 'une 1W1 1993 (3W Fh 33113)
          proposal and is now issuing this fflnal

          rule. ln addition1 elsewhere in this issue
          of the Federal hegister 1 FLA is issuing

          fflnal regulations that address the use of
          nutrient content claims and health claims
          on dietary supplements.

          ln addition1 section 203 of the LS act
          instructed FLA not to promulgate

          regulations before November W1 19931
          that establish recommended daily

          allowances for vitamins or minerals other
          than those recommended allowances
          speciffled in y101.9(c)(l)(iv) as in effect

          on October 01 1992. Therefore1 in the
          'anuary 01 19931 mandatory nutrition

          labeling fflnal rule1 FLA retained the U.S.
          hecommended Laily Allowances (U.S.

          hLA) values speciffled in y101.9(c)(l)(iv)1
          as in effect on October 01 1992. These
          U.S. hLA values were in large measure

          based on the hLA:s in the National
          Academy of Sciences: (NAS) publication

           44hecommended Lietary Allowancesl:: 1th
          edition1 190W (hef. 1). The agency did1
          however1 change the terminology for

          these values from 44U.S. hLA:s:: to
           44heference Laily lntayes (hLl:s).::

          FLA received over 400 responses to its
          'une 1W1 19931 proposed rule on the





                               nutrition labeling of dietary supplements1

                               each of these responses contained one or
                               more comments. hesponses were received

                               from consumers1 consumer advocacy

                               and local governments. Many comments
                               addressed issues covered by other

                               proposals that are a part of this overall
                               food labeling initiative1 and they will be

                               addressed in those documents. Other
                               comments were outside the scope of these

                               proposals and will not be discussed here.
                               About half of the comments supported

                               the proposal; about half of these
                               comments supported it without

                               modifflcation. These comments were
                               primarily from health professionals1

                               although a few were from that segment
                               of the food industry that produces foods
                               .
                               ln conventional food form. The
                               remainder of the comments that

                               supported the proposal suggested
                               modifflcations in various provisions of the

                               proposal. About half of the comments
                               opposed the proposal. These comments

                               were primarily from consumers who
                               opposed FLA:s regulation of dietary

                               supplements. A summary of the
                               comments that suggested changes and

                               the agency:s responses follow:
                               ll. Scope of New y101.30

                               1. One comment from a manufacturer of

                               dietary supplements supported the
                               proposed rule to allow only vitamins and

                               minerals that have hLl:s or Laily
                               heference Values (LhV:s) to be listed in

                               the nutrition label of dietary
                               supplements of vitamins and minerals.

                               Nowever1 several comments wanted
                               non-hLl vitamins and minerals to be

                               listed1 particularly those in the NAS:s
                               44hecommended Lietary Allowances::

                               (i.e.1 chloride1 chromium1 ffluoride1
                               manganese1 molybdenum1 selenium1 and

                               vitamin K). The comments pointed out
                               that advances in scientifflc ynowledge

                               have shown that these nutrients are
                               considered essential to human health.

                               Some comments also suggested listing
                               nutrients such as arsenic1 boron1 silicon1
                                .
                               tln1 and vanadium that they stated are of
                               mador signifflcance in human nutrition.





          Some of these comments suggested that
          an asterisy in the 44percent Lally Value::.

          column could refer to a footnote1 such as
           44No Laily Value has been established for

          this nutrient.:: Another comment
          suggested that these additional nutrients

          could be listed in a subsection of the
          nutrition panel below the bar after the

          last nutrient for which there is an hLl or
          LhV. One comment stated that to put

          information on nutrients of this type
          outside of the 44Nutrition Facts:: box
          would be inconvenient and may cause

          some consumers to overlooy the presence
          of these additional nutrients1 some of

          which should not be consumed in excess.
                         .
          The agency ls persuaded that it is
          appropriate to allow the nutrients that
          are listed as being essential to humans in

          the NAS:s 44hecommended Lietary
          Allowances:: (hefs. 2 and 1O)1 but for

          which FLA has not established hLl:s1 to
          be declared in the nutrition label of

          dietary supplements of vitamins and
          minerals when they are present in

          supplements at more than insignifflcant
          amounts. The agency agrees that there

          have been signifflcant advances in
          scientifflc ynowledge with respect to
          essential nutrient requirements since

          190W. ln 19W91 the NAS updated its
          hLA:s to include values for vitamin K

          and selenium and to maye signifflcant
          revisions in the allowances for several

          nutrients including vitamin b01 folate
          (folic acid)1 vitamin b121 magnesium1

          iron and kinc (hef. 2). ln addition1
          scientifflc advances permitted the NAS to

          revise the values1 ynown as 44Estimated
          Safe and Adequate Laily Lietary
          lntayes:: (ESALLl:s) in 19W0 for chloride

          (hef. 1O) and in 19W91 for three nutrients
          (biotin1 pantothenic acid1 and copper)1

          for which FLA established U.S. hLA:s in
          19131 and to establish new ESALLl:s for

          manganese1 ffluoride1 chromium1 and
          molybdenum (hef. 2).

          lt was in response to these scientifflc
          advances that FLA proposed hLl:s in

          the Federal hegister of November 211
          1991 (30 Fh 00300 at 00390 and 00393)

          for the nutrients mentioned previously
          that are included in the 19W0 and the

          19W9 NAS hLA:s but for which hLl:s





                                have not been established (i.e.1 chloride1
                                chromium1 ffluoride1 manganese1

                                molybdenum1 selenium1 and vitamin K).
                                The establishment of hLl:s would have

                                allowed these nutrients to be listed on
                                the nutrition label of dietary supplements

                                of vitamins and minerals as well of foods
                                ln conventional food form. Nowever1 as.

                                stated above1 section 203 of the LS act
                                instructed FLA not to promulgate

                                regulations that require the use of1 or
                                that are based upon1 recommended daily

                                allowances of vitamins or minerals before
                                November W1 19931 other than those
                                speciffled in y101.9(c)(l)(iv)1 as in effect

                                on October 01 1992. ln accordance with
                                this provision of the LS act1 the agency

                                issued a fflnal rule on 'anuary 01 1993 (3W
                                Fh 2200) that retained the former U.S.

                                hLA values. As a result1 the fflnal rule
                                did not include hLl:s for chloride1

                                chromium1 ffluoride1 manganese1
                                molybdenum1 selenium1 and vitamin K.

                                because the prohibition in section 203 of
                                the LS act has now expired1 the agency
                                .
                                ls proposing1 elsewhere in this issue of the
                                Federal hegister 1 to establish hLl values

                                for those nutrients listed by the NAS as
                                being essential to humans and that do

                                not already have hLl values. The agency.
                                ls proposing this action because these
                                nutrients are essential for the

                                maintenance of good health in humans.

                                ln recognition of the essentiality of these
                                nutrients and in response to the

                                comments summariked above1 the agency..
                                ls requiring ln new y101.30(b)(3) that

                                chloride1 chromium1 ffluoride1 manganese1
                                molybdenum1 selenium and vitamin K be
                                included in the nutrition label when

                                present in the dietary supplement. The
                                agency also is providing ln  .

                                y101.30(b)(4)(vi) that if any of these
                                nutrients are declared1 they are to be

                                followed by an asterisy in the 44percent
                                Laily Value:: column. The asterisy is to

                                refer to another asterisy that is placed at
                                the bottom of the table and that is

                                followed by the statement 44Laily Value
                                not established.:: This action is a logical
                                outgrowth of the nutrition labeling

                                proposal for dietary supplements because
                                that proposal put into issue the question

                                of whether the list of nutrients that FLA





          proposed be included in the nutrition
          label under y101.30 was the appropriate

          list. The comments have persuaded FLA
          that the list needs to be expanded in the

          manner described in this fflnal rule.
          FLA is not persuaded1 however1 that

          other trace elements for which the NAS
          has not established hLA:s or ESALLl:s

          should be declared within the nutrition
          label. The comments that suggested that

          such elements be included on the label
          provided some published reports that

          certain of these elements have been found
          to be essential in the diets of various
          animals but did not provide suMcient

          evidence for the agency to conclude that
          there is scientifflc consensus about their

          essentiality for the maintenance of good
          health in humans. The agency strongly

          believes that evidence of the usefulness of
          a nutrient for humans is necessary before

          that nutrient can be allowed to be listed      .
          within the nutrition label. This policy ls

          consistent with current y101.9(i)(3)
           (redesignated and revised in the 'anuary
          01 19931 fflnal rules1 as y101.9(y)(3))

          which prohibits a food:s label from
          stating or implying that the food has

          special dietary properties because of the
          presence of a substance when1 in fact1 the

          usefulness of the substance has not been
          established in human nutrition.

          ln addition1 in its proposed rule on
          mandatory nutrition labeling (33 Fh

          294W1 at 294931 'uly 191 1990)1 FLA
          stated that it was concerned about the

          possibility of a large number of nutrients
          being listed in nutrition labeling and
                             .
          about the way ln which their presence on
          the label may be interpreted by
          consumers. FLA expressed concern that

          the presence of a large number of
          nutrients could be misinterpreted as

          implying that a food has a greater public
          health signifflcance than may be the case.

          The potential for this happening and
          misleading the consumer about the

          contribution of the food to human
          nutrition is especially liyely if the
          nutrition label were to include nutrients

          not ynown to be important to humans.
          Therefore1 FLA believes that foods that

          list such nutrients in the nutrition label
          would be misbranded under section





                                403(a) of the act which prohibits

                                misleading information on the labels and
                                labeling of foods. Nowever1 statements
                                about amounts and percentages can be

                                made outside of the nutrition label as
                                discussed in the fflnal rule on nutrient

                                content claims published elsewhere in
                                this issue of the Federal hegister .
                                               .
                                The agency ls specifying that the new
                                nutrients to be listed appear in an order

                                that refflects the order that FLA
                                proposed in the nutrition labeling

                                proposal of November 211 1991 (30 Fh
                                00390). Vitamin K is to be listed after

                                vitamin E with the fat soluble vitamins1
                                selenium is to be listed before copper1

                                and the remaining nutrients (manganese1
                                ffluoride1 chromium1 molybdenum1 and

                                chloride) are to be listed after copper at
                                the bottom of the list.

                                The agency points out that it is not.
                                allowlng the listing of these nutrients on

                                the nutrition labels of foods in
                                conventional food form. Under

                                y101.9(c)(W)1 quantitative amounts by
                                weight of vitamins and minerals are not
                                listed within the nutrition label of foods
                                .
                                ln conventional food form. As a result1
                                the listing of only an asterisy in

                                condunction with the statement 44Laily
                                Value not established:: would provide

                                consumers with no indication of the
                                amount of chloride1 chromium1 ffluoride1

                                manganese1 molybdenum1 selenium and
                                vitamin K present in the food.

                                Therefore1 FLA has not provided in
                                y101.9 for a provision comparable to that
                                .
                                ln y101.30(b)(3) and (b)(4) that allows
                                for the placement of these nutrients on

                                the nutrition label.
                                FLA wishes to point out that y101.30(a)

                                only requires the label of a dietary
                                supplement of a vitamin or mineral to
                                                            .
                                bear nutrition labeling ln accordance
                                with the provisions of y101.30 if the
                                vitamins or minerals in the supplement

                                have an hLl or LhV. Accordingly1
                                dietary supplements containing only

                                chloride1 chromium1 ffluoride1 manganese1
                                molybdenum1 selenium1 or vitamin K

                                need not adhere to y101.30 until such
                                time as hLl:s are established for them.

                                2. A couple of comments said that
                                nutrients such as fat and sodium should





          not be required to be declared in the
          nutrition labeling of dietary supplements

          of vitamins and minerals. One of these
          comments said that dietary supplements

          are not tayen because of their fat or
          sodium levels1 and that these substances

          should not be declared. Other comments
          specifflcally supported the proposed rule
          .
          ln requiring that nutrients of this type be
          declared when they are present.
                         .
          The agency ls not persuaded that
          nutrients such as fat and sodium should

          not be declared in the nutrition labeling
          of dietary supplements of vitamins and

          minerals when present in signifflcant
          amounts. The madority of the comments

          supported FLA:s view that this
          information is needed to fully inform

          consumers of the nutrient content of
          these products. Although dietary

          supplements of vitamins and minerals are
          not consumed because of their fat or
          sodium levels1 this type of information on

          products that contain signifflcant levels of
          such nutrients will assist consumers in

          maintaining healthy dietary practices.
          Therefore1 the agency ls not maying the.

          requested change in the regulation.

          3. A few comments stated that dietary
          supplements of herbs and of other
          nutritional substances should be labeled

          under y101.30. One of these comments
          said it would be less confusing if all

          supplements were labeled in the same
          manner. Other comments agreed that

          dietary supplements of herbs should be
          labeled in accordance with y101.9 for

          foods in conventional food form.
          Nowever1 at least one comment requested

          that dietary supplements of herbs be
          exempt from declaring the 44core::

          nutrients if they have to be labeled in
          accordance with y101.91 and another
          comment said that these dietary

          supplements should not have to list
          44percent Laily Values.:: At least one

          comment stated that dietary
          supplements of herbs should have their

          own format for nutrition labeling1 and a
          few other comments requested that

          dietary supplements of herbs be exempt
          from all nutrition labeling. One of these

          comments agreed that FLA did not have
          the authority to exempt dietary





                                supplements of herbs from y101.9 and
                                wanted an amendment to the 1990

                                amendments that would exempt these
                                dietary supplements from nutrition
                                labeling. This comment said that dietary

                                supplements of herbs are not normally
                                consumed for their nutritive value1 and

                                that nutrition labeling on these products
                                is irrelevant and unimportant to

                                consumers.
                                As explained in the nutrition labeling

                                proposal for dietary supplements (3W Fh
                                33113 at 331101 'une 1W1 1993)1 the

                                difference in the labeling of dietary
                                supplements of vitamins or minerals and

                                of dietary supplements of herbs and of
                                other similar nutritional substances is a
                                result of section 403(q)(3)(F) of the act.

                                As stated above1 this section provides
                                that if a food to which section 411 of the

                                act applies (i.e.1 a dietary supplement of
                                vitamins or minerals) contains one or

                                more of the nutrients required to be
                                listed in nutrition labeling1 the label or
                                labeling of such food is to comply with

                                the requirements of section 403(q)(l) and
                                (q)(2) of the act in a manner that FLA

                                determines1 by regulation1 is appropriate
                                for such food. Other dietary supplements

                                are not subdect to section 403(q)(3)(F) of
                                the act and thus are subdect to regulation
                                under section 403(q) of the act in the

                                same manner as any other food. There is
                                nothing ln the 1990 amendments1 or.

                                elsewhere in the act1 that would allow
                                the agency to exempt the broad category

                                of dietary supplements of herbs and of
                                other similar nutritional substances from

                                section 403(q)(l) and (q)(2) of the act.
                                Thus1 supplements that are not dietary
                                supplements of vitamins and minerals are

                                appropriately subdect to nutrition
                                labeling under y101.9.

                                Under y101.91 the nutrition label of
                                dietary supplements of herbs and of

                                other similar nutritional substances may
                                be presented in either a full or simpliffled

                                format as speciffled in y101.9(d) or (f).
                                The simpliffled format in y101.9(f) may
                                be used when a supplement of herbs or of

                                other similar nutritional substances
                                contains insignifflcant amounts of seven or

                                more of the following nutrients: Calories1
                                total fat1 saturated fat1 cholesterol1





           sodium1 total carbohydrate1 dietary fflber1

           sugars1 protein1 vitamin A1 vitamin C1
           calcium1 and iron.

           FLA is not persuaded that nutrition
          labels on dietary supplements of herbs

           using the simpliffled format should be
           exempt from the requirement to declare
           the 44core:: nutrients (i.e.1 calories1 total

          fat1 sodium1 total carbohydrate1 and
           protein). The agency has stated its belief

          in the mandatory nutrition labeling fflnal
           rule (3W Fh 2019 at 2142) that this core

          information is essential to aid consumers
          in learning about the relative nutritional

           qualities of all foods1 and the information
           allows consumers to dudge the

           consequences of the food selections they
           maye. No new information was presented

          in the comments to change FLA:s
           position on this issue.

           The agency also advises that y101.9(d)(4)
           provides that foods subdect to y101.91

          including dietary supplements of herbs
           and of other similar nutritional

           substances1 are exempt from nutrition
          labeling requirements when all of the

           nutrients required to be declared under
           y101.9(c) are absent or are present in

          insignifflcant amounts.
           FLA is also not persuaded that nutrition

          labels on supplements of herbs should be
           excused from listing 44percent Laily

           Values.:: As called for in section
           2(b)(l)(A) of the 1990 amendments1 a

           primary purpose of the nutrition label is
           to help consumers maye informed food
           choices by enabling them to both

           comprehend the nutritional value of the
          food and to understand its relative

           signifflcance in the context of the total
           daily diet. The consumer research that

           the agency reviewed in the mandatory
           nutrition labeling fflnal rule supports

           FLA:s assertion that the listing of
           percent Laily Value improves consumers:

           abilities to maye correct dietary
          dudgments about a food in the context of

           a total daily diet (3W Fh 2019 at 2123).
           ln part1 this improved ability to maye

          dudgments is achieved by the use of a
           consistent system of percentages1 so that
           virtually all the nutrients on the label

           can be declared in equivalent units. Also1
           the percentages communicate





                                information about the nutrient level in a
                                food without the consumer having to be

                                concerned about the absolute level or
                                units of the underlying scale being used.

                                Therefore1 for the reasons stated1 the
                                agency has not acceded to the requests

                                that dietary supplements of herbs and of
                                other similar nutritional substances be

                                labeled under y101.301 have their own
                                format for nutrition labeling1 be exempt

                                from all nutrition labeling1 or be exempt
                                from declaring the 44core:: nutrients and
                                the 44percent Laily Values:: in y101.9.

                                4. One comment requested that the

                                language of yy101.30(a) and 101.9(d)(O)
                                be revised to refer to 44dietary
                                supplements that are represented as a

                                source of vitamins and mineralsl:: instead
                                of 44dietary supplements of vitamins and

                                minerals.:: This comment was concerned
                                that alfalfa tablets that have calcium as

                                a binder would be required to be labeled
                                under y101.30.

                                The agency would liye to maye clear that
                                it does not consider a product that

                                contains a substance that is a vitamin or
                                a mineral1 but that is used in the food

                                solely for technological purposes1 to be a
                                dietary supplement of a vitamin or

                                mineral because of the presence of that
                                substance. ln these circumstances1 the
                                product would not be represented as

                                supplying a vitamin or mineral (see
                                section 411(c) of the act). Thus1 alfalfa

                                tablets that have calcium as a binder
                                would be required to be labeled under

                                y101.9.
                                3. A few comments requested

                                clarifflcation of the type of nutrition
                                labeling that would be required for

                                44combination:: products that contain
                                herbs with added vitamins.

                                The agency advises that the type of
                                nutrition labeling that would be required

                                for products that contain herbs and
                                added vitamins would depend upon the

                                contents of the product as well as how
                                the product is represented. lf a
                                44combination:: product is primarily a

                                dietary supplement of vitamins and
                                minerals and is maryeted as such1 the

                                product would have to be labeled in
                                accordance with y101.30. lf the product
                                .
                                ls not primarily a dietary supplement of





          vitamins or minerals and is not

          represented as such1 it would have to be
          labeled in accordance with y101.9. The
           agency believes that the manufacturer

          mayes the determination as to whether a
          product is primarily a dietary

          supplement of an herb1 of vitamins or
          minerals1 or of a 44similar nutritional

          substance:: based on how it labels and
          formulates the product.

          The types of claims that are made on a
          dietary supplement will both determine1

           and be limited by1 whether it is a dietary
          supplement of vitamins or minerals or of

          herbs or of other nutritional substances.
           Section 411(b)(2)(b) of the act states

          that the labeling and advertising for
          dietary supplements of vitamins and

          minerals may not give prominence to or
          emphasike ingredients that are not

          vitamins1 minerals1 or represented as a
          source of vitamins or minerals. Thus1 if1

          for example1 a dietary supplement of an
          herbal extract adds vitamins and
          minerals yet remains primarily a dietary

          supplement of the herbal extract and is
           advertised as such1 section 411(b)(2)(b)

          of the act would not apply to the
          product. This would be the case when

          the label of such a product made no
          reference to any added vitamins or

          minerals other than in the ingredient list
           and nutrition label. Section 411(b)(2)(b)

          is discussed in more detail in the
          companion document on nutrient content

          claims for dietary supplements1 which is
          published elsewhere in this issue of the

          Federal hegister .
           0. One comment requested that the

          language of y101.30(a) be revised to
          delete 44and labeling.:: The comment says
                                      .
          that nutrition labeling ls not required on
          labeling under y101.9.

          The agency agrees with this comment
           and is revising the fflrst sentence of

           y101.30(a) to delete the words 44and
          labelingl:: thereby requiring that the

          required nutrition information appear on
          the label of dietary supplements of

          vitamins and minerals. FLA notes that
           y101.9(a)(2) allows the required nutrition
          information to be placed on labeling of

          foods in conventional food form when
          such foods are not in pacyaged form. The





                                 types of labeling that are identiffled in

                                 y101.9(a)(2) and that allow the required
                                 information to be clearly displayed at the

                                 point of purchase are counter cards1
                                 signs1 tags aMxed to the product1

                                 booylets1 looseleaf binders1 and other
                                 appropriate devices. The only manner in

                                 which the agency envisions that dietary
                                 supplements of vitamins and minerals

                                 would not be sold in pacyaged form is
                                 when they would be sold directly from

                                 buly containers. lf and when dietary
                                 supplements of vitamins and minerals are

                                 sold in this manner1 y101.30(g)
                                 specifflcally provides that they are subdect
                                 to the special labeling provisions in

                                 y101.9(d)(10) for foods sold from buly
                                 containers. Section 101.9(d)(10) allows

                                 for the required nutrition information to
                                 be displayed to consumers either on the

                                 labeling of the buly container plainly in
                                 view or in accordance with y101.9(a)(2).

                                 Supplements

                                 A. Serving Sike lnformation

                                 1. At least one comment stated that
                                 information on serving sike is not needed

                                 because it is given in the directions for
                                 use. Other comments supported the

                                 proposed rule stating that serving sike
                                 information should be declared in the

                                 nutrition label.
                                 The agency believes that information on

                                 serving sike is as essential on the
                                 nutrition label of dietary supplements of

                                 vitamins and minerals as it is on that of
                                 foods in conventional food form. First1

                                 this information may not be given in the
                                 directions. For instance1 the directions
                                 may state 44taye 3 tablets a day:: without

                                 indicating if they are to be tayen at one

                                 setting as one serving or spread out.
                                 throughout the day ln three separate

                                 servings. Thus1 it is fair to conclude that.
                                 ln many instances the serving sike will
                                 not be duplicative.

                                 Additionally1 this information quicyly

                                 informs the consumer about the amount
                                 of the product that contains the levels of

                                 nutrients declared. lt also provides a
                                 degree of consistency between the
                                 nutrition labels of dietary supplements of

                                 vitamins and minerals and those of foods
                                 ln conventional food form. FLA.





          concluded in the mandatory nutrition

          labeling fflnal rule that if the nutrition
          label was to be readily observable and
          comprehensible1 it must be presented in

          as consistent a manner as possible from
          label to label (3W Fh 2019 at 2130 and

          2139). This consistent looy to the
          required nutrition information on

          pacyages of both dietary supplements of
          vitamins and minerals and foods in

          conventional food form will help
          consumers to fflnd and recognike the

          information. Consistent treatment is
          important for the effective use of the

          nutrition label by consumers. As a.
          result1 the agency ls not changing

          y101.30 to delete the requirement for
          serving sike information.

          W. One comment stated that the
          reference amounts for dietary

          supplements should be speciffled in
          absolute terms but did not provide any

          data. The comment argued that absolute
          amounts are needed so that if

          comparative claims are made1 one
          product recommending consumption of1
                                                     .
          for example1 one tablespoon per day ls
          not compared to a product

          recommending fflve tablespoons per day.
          A few other comments supported the
          proposed defflnition for reference

          amounts.

          The agency has defflned the reference
          amount customarily consumed for a

          dietary supplement in y101.12(b) as 44the
          maximum amount recommended on the

          label for consumption per eating occasion
          or1 in the absence of recommendations1

          one tablet1 capsule1 pacyet1 or
          teaspoonful1 as appropriate.:: As
          discussed in the nutrition labeling

          proposal on dietary supplements (34 Fh
          33113 at 33110)1 the agency relied upon

          labeling recommendations in this
          defflnition because it believed that

          consumption is determined in large part
          by the amount recommended on the

          label of these products1 and it lacyed the
          data to specify absolute amounts. The

          agency requested comments on this
          approach in the proposal. No comments

          provided data for the agency to use in
          determining absolute amounts that could

          be used as reference amounts. Therefore1





                               the reference amount for dietary

                               supplements will continue to be based on
                               labeling recommendations.

                               The agency does not agree with the
                               comment that absolute amounts are

                               needed to prevent a product with a 1
                               tablespoon serving from being compared

                               to a product with a 3 tablespoon serving.
                               Lacying data to the contrary1 the agency

                               must assume that the recommended
                               amount on the label is the amount

                               customarily consumed. based on that
                               assumption1 it is consistent with y101.131

                               Oeneral principles for Nutrient Content

                               relates to comparative claims is further

                               9. A few comments stated that the term

                               44Serving Sike:: is confusing on dietary
                               supplements. A few comments had

                               questions about the determination of
                               serving sike1 and one of these comments

                               requested that the term 44hecommended
                               lntaye:: be used instead of the term

                               44Serving Sike.:: Another comment
                               suggested that the term 44Minimum

                               hecommended Serving Sike:: be used
                               when the label directions specify a range

                               of possible intayes for a product (e.g.1
                               two to three tablets per day). This

                               comment was concerned that 44someone
                               reading only the nutritional information

                               portion of the label will thiny that the
                               serving amount listed there is the

                               recommended amount when it is really
                               the maximum recommended amount.::

                               Other comments disagreed with this
                               position and supported the proposed rule

                               which stated that the serving sike should
                               refer to the maximum amount when a

                               range is speciffled for a product.
                               One comment asyed what the serving

                               sike is when the label recommends one to
                               four tablets per day. This comment also

                               asyed about serving sike when the label
                               recommends two tablets a day. Another

                               comment supported the statement in the
                               proposal that if there is no amount

                               recommended on the label1 the serving





          sike is one unit of the supplement. This

          comment observed that the issue arises
          as to how a determination can be made

          of 44servings per container:: if there is no
          recommendation as to serving sike. The

          comment stated that this issue needs to
          be considered to avoid a regulatory gap.
                         .
          The agency ls not persuaded that a term
          other than 44serving sike:: should be used

          to describe the basis for nutrient
          declaration for dietary supplements. lt

          would be confusing for consumers if
          dietary supplements of vitamins and

          minerals used a term such as
           44hecommended lntaye:: and other foods

          used the term 44Serving Sike.:: As
          discussed in the nutrition labeling

          proposal on dietary supplements (3W Fh
          33113 at 33110)1 the agency proposed

          that the nutrition labeling of vitamin or
          mineral supplements be presented in a

          manner that is as similar as possible to
          the nutrition labeling of other foods. The

          agency believes that use of the same
          term on all labels will help to avoid

          confusion. As use of the new nutrition
          label becomes more widespread1 and

          consumers become familiar with it1 they
          will come to understand that the serving

          sike represents the amount of product
          that they are liyely to consume in one

          eating occasion. Thus1 they will come to
          understand that for a dietary

          supplement1 the serving sike represents
          the amount of that product that they are

          liyely to consume at those times that
          they decide to taye the supplement.

          As explained in the proposal of 'une 1W1

          1993 (3W Fh 33113 at 33110)1 the agency
          believes that it is more useful for

          consumers to have the serving sike be
          based on the maximum amount

          recommended1 and to have the nutrition
          information be reported on this basis1

          than to have serving sike be based on the
          minimum or the average amount.

          Nowever1 in some cases1 the serving sike
          is the same regardless of whether the

          maximum or minimum amount is used.
          For example1 if label directions

          recommend a range of one to three
          tablets per day1 the serving sike is one

          tablet based on the fact that there are
          three separate eating occasions per day.





                                lf label directions recommend a range of

                                one to four tablets per day1 the serving
                                sike is also one tablet given the rounding

                                rules (i.e.1 four divided by three1 rounded
                                off to one). As for the question what is

                                the serving sike if the label recommends
                                two tablets per day1 the serving sike

                                would also be one tablet because of
                                rounding. ln the absence of

                                recommendations on the label1 a serving
                                sike of one unit is appropriate for
                                determining the 44Serving Sike:: and the

                                44Servings per Container.::
                                                      .
                                When the serving ls one unit1 the
                                number of servings per container would

                                duplicate the number of units declared
                                on the principal display panel. To avoid
                                                            .              .
                                redundancy the agency ls providing ln
                                y101.30(b)(2)1 as proposed1 that

                                information on servings per container
                                need not be provided when the identical

                                information is stated in the net quantity

                                will have to declare 44Servings per

                                contents information will be reported in

                                teaspoonfuls.

                                ln conclusion1 the agency has reexamined
                                the proposed rule with respect to these

                                comments on serving sike and believes
                                that no changes are needed.

                                These comments requested that the

                                The agency does not agree with the

                                should be reported as 44amount per day.::
                                As explained in the nutrition labeling

                                proposal for dietary supplements (3W Fh
                                33113 at 33111)1 the agency proposed in

                                the November 211 19911 document (30
                                Fh 00300 at 003W3) that nutrition

                                information be presented under the





          heading of 44per Unitl:: but that when

          label directions speciffled that more than  .
          one unit be consumed during a day1 lt

          also be presented under the heading of
           44per Lay:: (i.e.1 dual declaration). The

          agency proposed dual declaration when
          more than one unit was to be consumed
          per day to more fully inform consumers.

          The agency received a number of

          comments opposing the dual declaration
          of nutrition information on supplements.

          Some of these comments supported
          declaration on the basis of 44per day::

          because they believed that it is the total
          daily amount of nutrients that is
          important. Other comments favored a

           44per unit:: basis because some consumers
          may deviate from the recommended

          intaye1 or the intaye may be presented as
          a range. ln the preamble of the

          mandatory nutrition labeling fflnal rule of
          'anuary 01 1993 (3W Fh 2019 at 210W)1

          the agency stated that dual declaration
          may create a readability problem for

          consumers1 and that in general a 44per
          unit:: approach was more useful than a

           44per day:: approach.
          ln the nutrition labeling proposal for

          dietary supplements (3W Fh 33113 at
          33111)1 however1 the agency tooy a

          different approach. lt stated that it had
          tentatively concluded that declaration on

          the basis of 44per serving:: is preferable
          because reporting information solely on a

           44per unit:: basis could confuse consumers
          when more that one unit is to be

          consumed at one time (e.g.1 two capsules
          with each meal). The agency expressed

          concern that if consumers do not notice
          or do not understand the heading that

          states 44per unitl:: they might assume
          that the information is for the amount

          speciffled for consumption at one time
          (i.e.1 44per serving::)1 particularly because

          information for foods in conventional
          food form is expressed on a 44per serving::
          basis. Furthermore1 the agency

          tentatively concluded that consistency
          with the labeling of foods in conventional

          food form in this regard is the best
          approach because it will reduce consumer

          confusion (3W Fh 33113 at 33111).
          lnasmuch as most of the comments

                                provide any information demonstrating
                                that there is enhanced consumer

                                understanding or ease of use when
                                information is expressed on a daily basis1

                                comments. The agency concludes that

                                consistent change in y101.9(d)(4) appears
                                reasonable1 FLA believes that it is

                                necessary to address such a change
                                through notice-and-comment rulemaying.

                                The agency intends to propose such a
                                change in the near future.

                                C. Nutrient lnformation

                                1. Listing of Nutrient Names and
                                Amounts

                                1l. Several comments recommended that
                                information on the quantitative amount

                                by weight for the nutrients listed should
                                be presented in a separate column1 rather
                                                            .
                                than immediately followlng nutrient
                                names. These comments stated that

                                some consumers buy on the basis of
                                amounts1 using them to maye product

                                comparisons1 and that separate columns
                                would help consumers to more readily

                                locate this information. An additional
                                comment requested that information on

                                amounts be presented either in a separate
                                column or after the 44percent Laily

                                Value:: in parenthesis. On the other
                                hand1 several comments supported the
                                                       .
                                proposed rule1 argulng that the format
                                for dietary supplements of vitamins or





          minerals should follow the format for
          foods in conventional food form.

          The agency disagrees with the

          recommendation that information on the
          quantitative amount by weight for the
          nutrients listed should be presented in a

          separate column. The agency observes
          that space on the label is conserved by

          not requiring a separate column.
          Furthermore1 FLA believes that the

          comprehensibility of this information will
          be enhanced when it is presented

          immediately next to the name of the
          nutrient. As discussed in the mandatory

          nutrition labeling fflnal rule (3W Fh 2019
          at 2111)1 multiple column nutrient

          information displays are much more.
          diMcult than slngle column displays for
          consumers to use for product

          comparisons. both FLA:s fflrst
          experimental format study and the mador

          industry format study found that
          declaring nutrient amounts per serving in

          addacent columns of grams per milligram
          (g)mg) amounts and percent Laily Value

          led consumers to maye more mistayes
          and to taye longer on the product

          comparison type of tasy (hefs. 3 and 4).
          FLA:s second experimental study1
          however1 showed that when g)mg

          nutrient amount information was placed
          immediately next to the nutrient name in

          an unordered array1 and percents were
          placed in a column array1 the adverse

          effects on product comparison
          performance disappeared (hef. 3). Thus1
                        .
          the agency ls requiring in y101.30(b)(3)
          that the name of each nutrient listed

          shall be immediately followed by the
          quantitative amount by weight of the

          nutrient1 to be consistent with
          y101.9(d)(l)(i).

          12. A few comments requested that only
          the calcium portion of calcium gluconate

          be listed in the nutrition panel and on
          the principal display panel. Similarly1
          another comment requested that the

          agency clarify that vitamin b0 refers to
          pyridoxine1 not pyridoxine hydrochloride.

          The agency wishes to emphasike that the
          declaration of the quantitative amount by

          weight in the nutrition label is to indicate
          the weight of a particular nutrient and

          not the weight of the salt of that nutrient





                               used to maye the supplement. For
                               example1 only the calcium portion of

                               calcium gluconate is to be declared in the
                               nutrition label1 although in some

                               circumstances the weight of the whole
                               substance may appear on the principal

                               display panel if it clearly refers to the
                               whole substance1 such as when the
                               statement of identity states 44calcium

                               gluconate1 000 mg.:: Similarly1 only the
                               pyridoxine portion of pyridoxine

                               hydrochloride is to be declared in the
                               nutrition label. The agency believes that

                               no changes in y101.30 are necessary
                               based on these comments.

                               13. One comment recommended that
                               biotin and folate be declared in terms of

                               micrograms (pg)1 not mg1 and that
                               calcium and phosphorus be declared in

                               terms of mg1 not g. The comment stated
                               that consumers are more familiar with
                               these nutrients being expressed in this

                               manner.

                               FLA proposed on 'uly 191 1990 (30 Fh
                               29410) to change to the units suggested
                               in this comment. Nowever1 section 203 of

                               the LS act prohibited FLA from
                               adoptlng any reference values for.

                               vitamins and minerals different from the
                               U.S. hLA:s contained in y101.9(c)(l)(iv)1

                               as in effect on October 01 19921 until
                               after November W1 1993. Accordingly1

                               FLA adopted those U.S. hLA values as
                               the hLl:s1 with biotin and folate
                               expressed in terms of mg and calcium

                               and phosphorus expressed in terms of g.
                               Since the prohibition in section 203 of

                               the LS Act has now expired1 the agency
                               ls proposing elsewhere in this issue of the.

                               Federal hegister to amend y101.9 to
                               change the units of declaration for biotin

                               and folate to pg and for calcium and
                               phosphorus to mg. This proposal

                               responds fully to the comment. 14. One
                               comment was opposed to the agency:s

                               proposal1 in y101.30(b)(3)1 to allow
                               amounts of protein below 1 g to be left
                               off the nutrition label. This comment

                               requested that such amounts of protein
                               be declared because individuals who are

                               highly sensitive to monosodium
                               glutamate (MSO) may have adverse

                               reactions.
                               FLA has recogniked that certain





          individuals are sensitive to MSO and
          believes that the appropriate means to

          convey the presence of this ingredient to
          consumers is by use of the ingredient

          statement because MSO is a food
          lngredient. The agency reiterates that.

          dietary supplements of vitamins and
          minerals are required to comply with

           y101.4 (21 CFh 101.4)1 which requires
          full ingredient labeling of food.

          Furthermore1 in the Federal hegister of
          'anuary 01 19931 the agency proposed

          changes in the regulations pertaining to.
          lngredient labeling to accommodate
          those individuals who are sensitive to

          MSO. proposed y101.22 (3W Fh 2930)
          would require that when the amount of

          free glutamate in hydrolyked protein
          reaches a speciffled level1 the declaration

          in the ingredient statement must include
          the parenthetical 44(contains glutamate).::

          The agency has reexamined proposed
           y101.30 in response to this comment and
                                                      .
          notes that there is an inconsistency ln
          the labeling of protein1 total

          carbohydrate1 and dietary fflber between
           y101.9 and proposed y101.30. For

          example1 0.3 g to 0.99 g of these
          substances in a dietary supplement of a

          vitamin or mineral would not be declared
          under proposed y101.30(b)(3)1 yet these

           amounts in a food in conventional food
          form would be declared either as 441 g:: or

           44less than 1 g:: under y101.9(c). To        .
          correct this inconsistency1 the agency ls

          modifying y101.30(b)(3) to provide that
           amounts of nutrients that can be
          declared as kero in the nutrition label of

          foods in conventional food form shall not
          be declared in the nutrition labeling of

          dietary supplements of vitamins and
          minerals. Thus1 the agency ls requiring.

          the declaration of protein1 as well as
          total carbohydrate and dietary fflber1

          when they are present in amounts of 0.3
          g to 1 g. Amounts under 0.3 g would

          continue to not be listed in the nutrition
          label of dietary supplements of vitamins

           and minerals1 because these amounts
          would allow a declaration of kero in the
          nutrition labeling of foods in

          conventional form.

           13. One comment recommended that
           44active:: ingredients present at less than





                                2 percent of the Laily Value be allowed
                                to be listed in the nutrition label.
                                              .             .
                                The agency ls not allowlng vitamins and
                                minerals (except sodium and potassium1

                                which are not included in
                                y101.9(c)(W)(iv)) present at less than 2

                                percent of the Laily Value to be listed
                                because the declaration of such amounts

                                would be misleading. Such values are
                                insignifflcant under y101.9(f) and may be

                                declared as 0 percent of the hLl in the
                                nutrition labeling of foods in conventional

                                food form. They are amounts that are
                                dietetically trivial and physiologically
                                inconsequential. ln addition1 FLA is

                                concerned that some consumers will be
                                misled by the mere presence of names of

                                nutrients within the nutrition label1
                                because they would assume that

                                products with more nutrients listed have
                                a greater public health signifflcance than

                                those with less1 regardless of the amount
                                of each nutrient present.
                                              .
                                The agency ls unaware of any reason1 nor
                                does the comment present any reason1 for
                                      .
                                allowlng the declaration of nutrients that
                                are present in such small amounts. Thus1
                                the agency ls maying no change in.

                                1O. One comment requested that FLA
                                revise y101.30(b)(3)(i) to more clearly

                                The agency inadvertently did not address
                                the increments to be used for expressing
                                the quantitative amounts by weight of

                                vitamins and minerals. proposed
                                y101.30(b)(3)(i) stated that amounts of

                                vitamins and minerals are to be
                                expressed in the increments speciffled in

                                y101.9(c) using the units of measure and
                                the level of signifflcance given in

                                dropped. While the agency ls adoptlng





          this rule1 FLA recognikes that1 as the

          comment points out1 y101.9(c) does not
          address the question of the increments in

          which the quantitative amounts of
          vitamins and minerals are to be declared
          because in the nutrition labeling of foods
          .
          ln conventional food form1 vitamins1 and
          minerals are declared only as a

          percentage of the Laily Value. The
          quantitative amounts by weight of these

          nutrients1 except for potassium and
          sodium1 which are considered

          electrolytes1 are not required in the
          nutrition label of conventional foods.

          The agency has considered this issue and
          notes that dietary supplements1 unliye

          most foods in conventional food form1 are
          fabricated to contain specifflc amounts of

          vitamins and minerals. lt is for this
          reason that the vitamins and minerals in

          dietary supplements are categoriked as
          Class l nutrients1 and that under

          y101.9(g)(4)1 a food is misbranded if it
          contains less of an added vitamin or

          mineral than the amount declared on the
          label. ln view of how dietary

          supplements of vitamins and minerals are
          made1 the agency agrees that it mayes no

          sense to permit the amounts of vitamins
          and minerals in such products to be

          rounded and declared only in speciffled
          increments. Therefore1 the agency has

          modiffled y101.30(b)(3)(i) to provide that
          the actual amounts of vitamins and

          minerals in the supplement are to be
          declared using the units of measure
          speciffled in y101.9(c)(W)(iv)1 except that
                        .
          keros followlng decimal points may be
          dropped.

          With respect to levels of signifflcance1

          that is1 the number of decimal places
          used in declaring amounts1 the agency

          proposed that only the levels of
          signifflcance shown in y101.9(c)(W)(iv)

          could be presented. ln some cases1
          however1 the number of decimal places
          allowed is not suMcient to express actual

          amounts of certain vitamins and minerals
          because the amounts are very small. For

          example1 a product that contains 10
          percent of the Laily Value for copper

          would contain 0.2 mg of copper. lf the
          amount of copper had to be expressed

          using the same level of signifflcance as





                                that used in y101.9(c)(W)(iv) for
                                expressing its hLl (i.e.1 2 mg)1 the lowest
                                amount that could be declared would be

                                1 mg1 which would be inaccurately high.
                                To ensure that amounts of vitamins and

                                minerals that have nutritional
                                signifflcance can be declared1 the agency
                                .
                                ls modifying y101.30(b)(3)(i) to provide
                                that amounts shall be expressed in the

                                increments speciffled in y101.9(c)1 except
                                that additional levels of signifflcance may
                                be used when the number of decimal

                                places indicated is not suMcient to
                                express lower amounts (e.g.1 the hLl for

                                copper is given in whole mg1 but the
                                quantitative amount may be declared in
                                tenths of a mg). Additionally1 the agency

                                apparent inconsistency between the
                                requirement in y101.30(b)(3)(ii) that

                                nutrients 44be listed in the order speciffled
                                in y101.9(c) except that calcium and
                                iron1 when present1 should be grouped

                                with other mineralsl:: and the sequence
                                of vitamin L and vitamin E in the

                                examples provided in y101.30(c)(W). The
                                comment recommended that the
                                appropriate order of nutrients be clariffled

                                in the regulations.
                                While FLA fflnds no inconsistency with

                                the sequence of vitamin L and vitamin E
                                in the sample labels provided in

                                y101.30(c)(W)1 the agency points out that
                                there was an error in the order of

                                nutrients in y101.9(c)(W)(iv) in the
                                Federal hegister of 'anuary 01 1993 (3W
                                Fh 2221). FLA published a correction in

                                the Federal hegister of April 11 1993 (3W
                                Fh 11104)1 which listed the order as





           follows: Vitamin A1 vitamin C1 calcium1

           iron1 vitamin L1 vitamin E1 thiamin1
           ribofflavin1 niacin1 vitamin b01 folate1

           vitamin b121 biotin1 pantothenic acid1
           phosphorus1 iodine1 magnesium1 kinc1

           and copper. This order is the one used by
           FLA in the 'une 1W1 19931 proposal on

           nutrition labeling of dietary supplements
           of vitamins and minerals1 except that

           calcium and iron were listed with the
           minerals1 followlng pantothenic acid..

           The agency wishes to maye these
           regulations as clear as possible.

           Therefore1 in response to the comment:s
           request for clarifflcation of the

           appropriate order of nutrients1 and to
           maye clear where in the list to include

           the nutrients that have no hLl but that
           are required to be included in the

           nutrition label on dietary supplements of
           vitamins and minerals when they are

           present1 FLA is revising y101.30(b)(3)(ii)
           to specify the exact order in which

           vitamins and minerals are to be declared
           (see section ll. comment 1. of this

           document). Any nutrients not present in
           the supplement1 or present at

           insignifflcant levels1 must be omitted from
           the list.

           1W. At least one comment requested that
           vitamins be listed in alphabetical order.

           Another comment requested that calcium
           and magnesium be the fflrst minerals to

           be listed.

           The agency has not accepted these
           suggestions. As discussed in the nutrition

           labeling proposal for dietary supplements
           (3W Fh 33119)1 with the exception of

           calcium and iron1 FLA proposed in
           y101.30(b)(3)(ii) that nutrients declared

           in the nutrition labeling of vitamin or
           mineral supplements be listed in the

           order that nutrients are listed in the
           nutrition labeling of foods in

           conventional food form. The agency
           proposed that calcium and iron be listed

           after the listing of any vitamins that are
           present so that all of the vitamins will be

           grouped together. While vitamin A and
           vitamin C are to be listed fflrst1 consistent

           with y101.9(c)1 they are then followed by
           the fat-soluble vitamins1 then the

           water-soluble vitamins and the minerals.
           The NAS in its hLA publications has





                                traditionally grouped the fat-soluble

                                vitamins ahead of the water-soluble
                                vitamins. The agency notes that this

                                order is followed on the labels of many
                                vitamin supplements in the maryetplace.

                                The comment requesting alphabetical
                                order gave no convincing dustifflcation for
                                       .
                                followlng a different order1 and1 thus1
                                FLA is not changing the order.

                                Additionally1 the comment requesting
                                that calcium and magnesium be the fflrst

                                minerals to be listed presented no reason
                                for the agency to maye this change.

                                Calcium and iron are required to be the
                                fflrst minerals listed on the labels of foods
                                .
                                ln conventional food form. ln the absence
                                of any reason for why calcium and

                                magnesium should be the fflrst minerals
                                to be declared on the labels of

                                supplements of vitamins and minerals1.
                                the agency ls maying no change in the
                                order for minerals.

                                19. One comment requested that

                                y101.30(b)(3)(ii) be revised to require
                                that potassium be listed with the other

                                minerals1 preferably last on the list. This
                                comment and others expressed confusion

                                about whether potassium could be listed
                                and requested clarifflcation. One

                                comment requested that y101.30(b)(3) be
                                clariffled to allow for the voluntary listing

                                of potassium in dietary supplements
                                because1 according to the comment1
                                potassium is usually present at less than

                                100 mg per tablet1 primarily because of
                                existing FLA restrictions on potassium

                                salt preparations.

                                The agency agrees that the listing of
                                potassium needs clarifflcation. potassium

                                nutrition label of foods in conventional

                                food form. Nowever1 it can be listed
                                voluntarily1 and when it is1 it is to be
                                listed under sodium1 as an electrolyte

                                rather than with the minerals. ln
                                contrast1 the agency proposed that

                                potassium be required to be listed on the
                                nutrition label of dietary supplements of

                                vitamins and minerals when present in
                                supplements at more than insignifflcant

                                amounts (i.e.1 3 mg and above)1
                                consistent with the listing of other

                                vitamins and minerals. The agency
                                ynows of no reason why potassium in





          supplements of vitamins and minerals
          should be treated differently from other

          vitamins and minerals in these products1
          and the comment did not provide a

          reason for why the listing of potassium
          should be voluntary rather than
                                                    .
          mandatory. Therefore1 the agency ls not
          maying this change. Nowever1 the agency
          .
          ls modifying the language of
           y101.30(b)(3) to maye it clear that the

          declaration of potassium is required
          when it is present at more than
          insignifflcant amounts. To this end1 FLA

          has revised the second sentence of
           y101.30(b)(3) to state: 44ln addition1

          potassium t t t shall be declared1 except
          when present at an amount that allows a

          declaration of kero t t t :: .
          With respect to the placement of

          potassium within the nutrition label1
          FLA agrees with the comment that the

          regulation should be modiffled. The
          proposal stated that nutrients that are

          present shall be listed in the order
          speciffled in y101.9(c)1 which would mean

          that potassium1 as well as sodium1 would
          precede the listing of any other vitamins

          or minerals present in a supplement.
          FLA has concluded that it is not
          appropriate and might confuse

          consumers to have the declaration of
          potassium1 as well as that of sodium1

          precede the declaration of other vitamins
          and minerals on these labels because

          traditionally vitamins have appeared
          fflrst. The agency agrees with the

          comment that it is appropriate for
          potassium to be listed at the bottom of

          the list because it is an electrolyte1 and
          the electrolyte1 chloride1 is listed at the
          bottom. For the same reason1 the agency

          concludes that sodium should be listed
          with the other electrolytes. Accordingly1
                        .
          the agency ls revising y101.30(b)(3)(ii) to
          state that sodium and potassium should
                                              .
          be listed1 in that order1 followlng the
          electrolyte chloride at the bottom of the

          list of minerals.
          2O. One comment requested clarifflcation

          regarding the labeling to be used on a
          pacyage that has two compartments1

          each containing a different supplement to
          be tayen at the same time1 three times

          daily with meals. The company asyed if





                               the regulations permit the information

                               for both supplements to be reported

                               aggregately in one nutrition label that

                               has one column of names and amounts

                               and one column of percent Laily Values.

                               The fflrm requested that if an aggregate

                               label is not permitted1 the additional

                               nutrition label be permitted in a pacyage

                               insert. The company also asyed how the


                               information should be presented if

                               children one to four years of age are to

                               taye the same amount as adults1 and how

                               it is to be presented if such children are

                               to taye half the amount of adults.

                               The agency advises that if two

                               supplements are to be tayen at the same

                               time1 one unit of each three times daily1


                               the nutrition information for both

                               supplements must be reported

                               aggregately. ln this situation1 the serving

                               sike must clearly state that a serving

                               includes one of each supplement1 with

                               one column listing names and the total

                               quantitative amount by weight for both

                               supplements and another column

                               containing the total percent Laily

                               Values. lf this product is also represented

                               for use by children one to four years of

                               age1 the percent Laily Values for this age

                               group would have to be presented in a

                               third column. ln the case where the


                               serving sike is different for children1 a

                               nutrition label for adults and a separate

                               nutrition label for children must be used

                               to avoid confusion.

                               2l. A few comments requested that the

                               declaration of the percent of vitamin A

                               present as beta -carotene be mandatory.

                               These comments argued that this


                               information is needed to help consumers

                               compare the amounts of beta -carotene
                               .
                               ln various products. They stated that

                               this information would help consumers

                               understand claims such as 44Now with

                               beta -carotene.:: One of these comments

                               requested the voluntary declaration of

                               the quantitative amount of beta

                               -carotene in addition to the percentage of

                               vitamin A present as beta -carotene.

                               This comment stated that calculations of

                               vitamin A and beta -carotene values are

                               diMcult even for scientists1 and that


                               merely providing a percentage will not

                               allow consumers to readily determine





          dust how much beta -carotene is present

          in the product. The comment requested
          that the amount of beta -carotene be

          expressed in mg. Two comments
          requested that the percent of vitamin A
          present as retinol also be mandatory.

          One of these comments explained that
          most people are better off getting their

          vitamin A from beta -carotene rather
          than from retinol because beta -carotene
          .
          ls safer in high doses and may help
          reduce the risy of certain cancers1 heart

          disease1 cataracts1 and other health
          problems.

          FLA is not persuaded that the
          declaration of the percent of vitamin A

          present as beta -carotene should be
          mandatory because quantitative

          recommendations about the intaye of
          beta -carotene have not yet been

          established by the scientifflc community.
          ln the 'uly 191 19901 mandatory

          nutrition labeling proposal (33 Fh 29410
          at 29493)1 the agency set out the factors

          that it considered in deciding whether a
          nutrient or food component should be
                                       .
          mandatory or voluntary ln nutrition
          labeling:

          The agency has proposed to maye the
          declaration of a nutrient or food
                                      .
          component mandatory ln nutrition
          labeling when quantitative intaye

          recommendations with respect to the
          nutrient or component are highlighted in

          the reports t t t (e.g.1    44heduce total fat
          intaye to 3Oy0 or less of calories.:: t t t)1

          and the nutrient or component is of
          particular public health signifflcance as

          defflned in several recent consensus
          documents t t t. On the other hand1 for
          those nutrients or food components for

          which quantitative intaye
          recommendations are not highlighted but

          that do have some public health
          signifflcance t t t1 or for which

          quantitative recommendations are
          available but that are not of pressing

          public health importance (e.g.1 the
          hecommended Lietary Allowances for

          several vitamins and minerals t t t)1 the
          agency ls proposing to maye declaration.

          of the nutrient or component voluntary.
          (33 Fh 294W1 at 29493.) The agency

          concludes that its decision to have the





                                percent of vitamin A present as beta
                                                            .
                                -carotene be voluntary ls consistent with
                                these guidelines because quantitative
                                intaye recommendations have not been

                                established. On the other hand1 if a
                                claim about beta -carotene is made1

                                information on the percent of vitamin A
                                present as beta -carotene is needed to

                                help consumers to understand the claim.
                                Therefore1 the agency ls modifying.

                                y101.30(b)(3)(iv) to require declaration
                                of the percent of vitamin A present as

                                beta -carotene when a claim is made
                                about beta -carotene. The agency

                                tentatively concludes that a parallel
                                change in y101.9(c)(W)(vi) for the labels

                                of foods in conventional food form is
                                appropriate. The agency intends to

                                propose this change in the near future.
                                The agency ls acceptlng the comment:s..

                                suggestion to provide that when the
                                percent of vitamin A present as beta

                                -carotene is declared1 the quantitative
                                amount of beta -carotene may also be
                                                                        .
                                declared voluntarily. The agency ls
                                persuaded by the comment that this

                                information on the labels of dietary
                                supplements of vitamins and minerals

                                would be useful to those individuals who
                                are interested in maintaining a certain
                                quantitative intaye of beta -carotene in

                                their diets.

                                The agency notes that the comment
                                requested that the amount of beta

                                -carotene be declared in terms of mg..
                                Nowever1 the agency ls requiring that
                                international units (lU) be used in place

                                of mg to be consistent with the
                                declaration of vitamin A. FLA fflnds the

                                usefulness of this added information
                                would be reduced if the units used to

                                quantify vitamin A and beta -carotene
                                levels differ. Accordingly1 the agency ls    .

                                amending y101.30(b)(3)(iv) to provide
                                that when the percent of vitamin A

                                present as beta -carotene is declared1 the
                                quantitative amount in terms of lU may

                                also be declared1 e.g.1    44Vitamin A 3000
                                lU (90 percent (4300 lU) as beta

                                -carotene::). The agency intends to
                                propose a parallel change in

                                y101.9(c)(W)(vi) as soon as possible.
                                Until the agency does so1 the agency
                                advises that it is unliyely that it will taye





          enforcement action against foods
          regulated under y101.9 that declare beta

          -carotene in a manner consistent with
           y101.30(b)(3)(iv) as long as they comply

          with y101.9 in all other respects.
          Additionally1 the provision on type sike

          requirements for the added statement on
          beta -carotene in y101.30(c)(O) is

          corrected to refer to paragraph (b)(3)(iv)
          instead of to (b)(3)(ii). There was an

          inadvertent error in this reference in the
          proposal.

          With respect to retinol1 the agency
          concludes that1 in accordance with the

          guidelines set out above1 the declaration
          of retinol should be neither mandatory

          nor voluntary because of the absence of
          quantitative intaye recommendations and
          of public health signifflcance. Thus1 the
                   .
          agency ls not changing the proposed rule
          to provide for the inclusion of retinol in

          the nutrition label.
          22. One comment requested that

           y101.30(b)(3)(v) be revised to 44permit
          common synonymsl:: instead of only the

          synonyms speciffled. This comment
          stated that allowlng all synonyms would.

          provide people with more information
          and would ensure that the contents of

          products were1 in fact1 comprehensible to
          more people. The comment mentioned1

          for example1 that niacin is ynown by
          many as vitamin b3 and vitamin E by
          the name alpha-tocopherol. Another

          comment expressed support for
          restricting the use of synonyms to the

          ones allowed in the proposed rule.
          The agency ls not persuaded that the.

          provision on synonyms should be revised
          to 44permit common synonymsl:: instead

          of only the synonyms speciffled. The
          terminology that the agency has

          recogniked is that which is used in NAS:
          hLA table (hef. 2). These include:

          Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)1 thiamin
           (vitamin bl)1 ribofflavin (vitamin b2)1

          folate (folacin)1 and calories (energy).
          The agency has restricted the use of
          synonyms to simplify nutrition labeling

          and to avoid potential confusion among
          consumers. The agency believes that
                .
          allowlng the unrestricted use of other
          synonyms will contribute to confusion

          about the nutrients that are present in





                                the product. lt will also maye product

                                comparisons more diMcult because of the
                                absence of consistent terminology.

                                Therefore1 FLA is not maying the
                                change requested by the comment.

                                23. At least one comment requested that

                                the nutrition label of vitamins with iron1
                                for example1 be allowed to highlight the

                                listing of iron. The comment stated that.
                                such highlighting ls a useful and

                                necessary tool to differentiate various.
                                product lines. The agency ls not

                                persuaded that the highlighting of iron in
                                the example described in the comment is
                                necessary for consumers to differentiate

                                between various product lines because

                                the name1 or statement of identity1 of the
                                product must identify the product as a

                                identifflcation is suMcient to differentiate
                                the product from other multivitamin

                                products. As discussed in the mandatory
                                nutrition labeling fflnal rule (3W Fh 2019

                                at 213W)1 FLA is not permitting
                                highlighting of this type because it can

                                be used inconsistently in a way that
                                would be potentially misleading to

                                consumers. Among products with similar
                                nutrition profflles1 some would highlight

                                certain nutrients and others would not.
                                Consumers could not depend on the fact

                                that all labels of similar products would
                                looy the same1 and the differences in

                                highlighting could undermine the
                                credibility of the information on the

                                nutrition label and lead to consumer
                                confusion. Accordingly1 the agency ls not  .

                                providing for the highlighting requested
                                by the comment.

                                24. A number of comments suggested

                                that the source of a vitamin or mineral
                                be included in the nutrition label
                                                       .
                                immediately followlng the listing of that
                                vitamin or mineral1 in a manner similar

                                to the allowed listing of beta -carotene as
                                a source of vitamin A. One comment

                                stated that this information should be
                                listed in a separate column entitled

                                44Source.:: One comment requested that
                                the source information should at least be

                                optional. The comments stated that if
                                this suggestion is adopted1 it will be

                                unnecessary to repeat source information
                                in the ingredient statement1 and one





          comment requested that the regulations

          on ingredient labeling be revised

           accordingly. The comments said that this

           approach would conserve space and more

          effectively communicate source

          information to consumers.


          The agency notes that the parenthetical

          listing of the source of a vitamin or

          mineral in the nutrition label is a

          common practice by some1 but not all1

          manufacturers in the dietary supplement

          industry. The agency fflnds1 however1 that

          the comments submitted failed to provide

           adequate 3.ustifflcation and supporting

          information demonstrating that

           adoption1 on an industry-wide basis1 of

          this manner of expressing nutrition and

           .
          lngredient information would result in a

          nutrition label that is readily observable

           and comprehensible1 as required by the

           act. Comments have not demonstrated

          that consumers will be able to distinguish

           and understand the meaning of both the

          nutrition and ingredient information

          provided. FLA has no means on which

          to determine1 for example1 whether the

          name of the source of the nutrient is

          indeed that and not the chemical name

          of the nutrient. The comments also failed

          to provide data to demonstrate that this

          manner of presentation truly conserves


          label space1 especially if additional

          columns are added to the nutrition label.

          Further1 if as suggested by one comment1

          source information within the nutrition

          label were made optional1 the consistency

          of presentation of information that has

          been a guiding principle of the agency

          throughout the food label reform efforts

          would be violated. Accordingly1 the
                    .
           agency ls not providing for the

          parenthetical listing of nutrient source

          within the nutrition label.


          The agency advises1 however1 that it

          would be receptive to a adequately

          supported petition on this issue1 and that
           .
          lt will act expeditiously on such petition.

           Oiven that1 elsewhere in this issue of the
                                              .
          Federal hegister 1 the agency ls

          establishing a date of applicability of

          'uly 11 19931 for the regulation governing

          nutrition labeling of dietary supplements1


          if a petition is promptly submitted1 that

          petition could be acted upon before the





                                date of applicability.

                                Any petition submitted to permit source

                                declaration within the nutrition label
                                would have to address1 in detail1 at least

                                the issues of how the source information
                                is to be consistently and clearly

                                expressed1 and why this manner of
                                expression is advantageous to the

                                consumer.

                                because a primary purpose of the
                                nutrition label is to allow consumers to

                                compare the nutrition profflle of products
                                at the point of purchase1 it is imperative

                                that there be a high degree of consistency
                                in the presentation of nutrition

                                information for all dietary supplements.
                                FLA would also need information on

                                precisely how source information should
                                be expressed within the nutrition label.

                                For example1 how would the source
                                information be expressed if a slngle  .
                                .
                                lngredient (e.g.1 fflsh liver oil) is a source
                                of a number of nutrients (e.g.1 vitamins

                                A and L) within a dietary supplement1
                                lf the source is required to be listed

                                multiple times1 how does this conserve
                                label space1 Also1 would multiple listing

                                of a source mislead consumers about the
                                amount of the ingredient in the food1

                                Conversely1 if a nutrient in a supplement
                                ls provided from several sources (e.g.1.

                                iodine from yelp and potassium iodide)1

                                how would this information be clearly
                                and consistently conveyed1 Would the

                                source listed be all sources1 or only the
                                primary source1 of the nutrient1 lf source

                                listing in the nutrition label were to be
                                limited to the primary source1 how would

                                the primary source be determined1 Are
                                safeguards necessary to ensure that

                                consumers are not misled by
                                lnappropriate emphasis on certain.

                                sources of nutrients1 For example1 how
                                would consumers be fully informed and

                                be protected from being misled if a
                                nutrient is derived from more than one

                                source1 and only the primary source is
                                listed1 particularly if a valued ingredient

                                provides some1 but not all1 of the
                                nutrient in question1

                                Should source information be permitted

                                in the nutrition label only when there is
                                some signifflcance to the source1 For

                                example1 because there are potential





           safety concerns about high intayes of

           vitamin A from some other sources1 FLA
          found that there is was a public health

           reason for permitting beta -carotene to
           be shown as a source of vitamin A.

           Should such a fflnding be a prerequisite
          for permitting source labeling1 lf source

          labeling is limited to cases in which the
           source is signifflcant (e.g.1 particularly

           valued sources1 concern about other
           potential sources)1 how should such

           signifflcance be consistently determined1
           Also1 any petition on source labeling ln     .

           the nutrition label should address the
          issue of clarity of presentation. Section

           2(b)(l)(A) of the 1990 amendments
           states that the nutrition information

           should be readily observable and
           comprehensible. Would adding

          information about the source of nutrients
           detract from the comprehensibility of the

           nutrition label1 Oiven that source
          information will be available in the
           .
          lngredient statement1 would source
           declarations unnecessarily burden the

           nutrition label and detract from its
           primary purpose of providing a nutrient

           profflle of the product1 Would it be more
           diMcult for consumers to fflnd the listing

           of the quantitative amounts by weight of
           nutrients in the nutrition label when

           source information is given1 petitions on
           this issue would be strengthened by the

          inclusion of consumer survey or other
           similar data showlng that consumers.

           readily observe and comprehend
          information presented in the manner

           suggested by the comments.
           As discussed in the mandatory labeling

          fflnal rule (3W Fh 2019 at 2110)1 dietary
           supplements of vitamins and minerals1

          liye other foods1 are required to bear a
           complete list of ingredients. Under

           section 403(i)(2) of the act1 the statement
           of ingredients must list all ingredients of

           these foods1 including 1 for example1
          lactose and other fflllers1 artifflcial colors1

          fflavors1 binders1 and excipients1 as well as
           the source of the vitamins and minerals

          in the dietary supplement. This section
           of the act provides FLA with authority

           to grant exemptions from the ingredient
          listing requirements1 but such

           exemptions have not been sought by the





                                dietary supplement industry. The agency
                                advises that the fact that the name of an
                                .
                                lngredient appears elsewhere on the label.

                                Therefore1 any petition on this subdect
                                must address the issue of how this

                                manner of presentation of the source of
                                nutrients continues to fulfflll the primary

                                lactose).
                                The agency advises that its current

                                policy1 as stated in the Federal hegister
                                of August 21 1913 (3W Fh 20130) and

                                March 101 1919 (44 Fh 10003)1 and in
                                subsequent correspondence with industry

                                (hefs. 0 and 1)1 is that the label for
                                dietary supplements of vitamins and

                                minerals must contain a list of nutrients
                                and a separate full statement of
                                lngredients1 except those exempted by.

                                Therefore1 for all the reasons cited above1

                                FLA has decided not to taye the action
                                requested by these comments1 pending
                                receipt and review of petitions on this

                                issue.
                                2. Listing of percent Laily Value

                                23. The agency received a number of
                                comments that opposed the use of the

                                term 44percent Laily Value:: and that
                                stated that they preferred to continue to

                                use the term 44percent U.S. hLA.::
                                The agency disagrees with these

                                comments. As explained in the fflnal rule
                                on hLl:s that published in the Federal

                                hegister of 'anuary 01 1993 (3W Fh 2200
                                at 2201 and 220W)1 the agency has
                                established two sets of label references

                                values (i.e.1 hLl:s1 which were previously
                                the U.S. hLA:s1 and LhV:s). because

                                the agency believed the use of the two
                                terms on food labels could be confusing
                                                                     .

          The comments did not provide any new

          arguments or data that were not
          considered in that rulemaying.

          Furthermore1 the agency advises that it
          ynows of no reason why dietary

          supplements of vitamins and minerals
          should not use the terminology

          prescribed for foods in general.
          Consistency in terminology will assist
          consumers in maintaining healthy dietary

          practices by facilitating their use of the
          nutrition label to construct a healthy

          diet that includes both dietary
          supplements and foods in conventional
                                                   .
          food form. Therefore1 the agency ls not
          maying any change in the regulations in

          response to these comments.
          2O. One comment requested that the

          agency eliminate the use of the term
          44hLl:: and use the term 44LhV:: for both

          macronutrients and micronutrients. The
          comment stated that it is confusing to

          have more the one term.

          The comment appears to be requesting
          new terms not only for the nutrition
          label of dietary supplements of vitamins

          and minerals but also for the nutrition
          label of foods in conventional food form.

          The terms 44hLl:: and 44LhV:: were
          established in the fflnal rule on hLl:s (3W

          Fh 2200).

          As discussed in the proposed rule of 'uly
          191 1990 (33 Fh 29410 at 29419)1 the
          distinction between the hLl:s and LhV:s
          .
          ls necessary for several reasons. First1 the
          hLl:s are based on the hLA:s1 which are

          considered intaye levels to be achieved.
          Nowever1 while some LhV:s are based on

          recommendations to increase or maintain
          intaye of the particular food component1

          other LhV:s refflect levels that are
          limitations on intaye. Furthermore1 many

          of the LhV:s must be based on a specifflc
          caloric intaye1 and1 unliye the hLl:s1 the

          LhV:s are not relevant for infants and
          young children. Finally1 the hLl:s serve

          as criteria for use in several regulatory
          functions1 such as the application of the

          agency:s food fortifflcation policy and the
          assessment of the nutritional equivalency

          of imitation foods. The LhV:s do not
          have such uses. Therefore1 FLA believes

          that it is appropriate to treat hLl:s and
          LhV:s as two different sets of reference





                               values. Nowever1 the agency notes that
                               both terms are referred to as 44Laily

                               Values:: on the nutrition label. The
                                agency believes that the use of a single

                               term on the label will limit consumer
                               confusion. Thus1 the concern articulated

                               by the comment is fully addressed by
                               FLA:s current regulatory scheme.
                                                             .
                               Accordingly1 the agency ls not maying
                               the requested change.

                                2l. One comment requested that
                               products containing 3 to 11 mg of

                               potassium should be allowed to state1
                                44Contains less than 1 percent of the
                               Laily Value of this nutrient.:: The

                               comment explained that 11 mg of
                               potassium expressed to the nearest whole
                                                                     .
                               percent comes to 440 percent Lally Value::
                                (31300 mg divided by 111 which rounds to

                               kero)1 yet y101.9(c)(3) only allows
                                amounts less than 3 mg to be considered

                                as kero. As a result1 the nutrition label of
                               such a product would state 13 mg

                               potassium and 0 percent Laily Value.
                               The comment expressed concern that
                               such apparently contradictory statements

                               would be confusing to consumers.

                               The comment identiffles a concern
                                applicable to dietary supplements and

                               foods in conventional food form1 namely
                               that consumers may fflnd it confusing
                               when there is a quantitative amount by

                               weight for a nutrient1 and yet the percent
                               Lally Value states 0 percent. This.

                               seeming confflict can occur with sodium1
                               potassium1 and total carbohydrate on

                               labels of both supplements and foods in
                               conventional food form1 and with some

                               vitamins and minerals in dietary
                               supplements1 when both quantitative
                                                                         .
                                amounts by weight and percent Lally
                               Values are given. To avoid any possible
                               confusion that these apparently

                               inconsistent declarations may cause1 the
                                agency ls modifying y101.30(b)(4)(ii) to.

                               provide for the declaration of 44less than
                                1yO:: in the percent of Laily Value

                               column when the declaration of the
                               quantitative amount by weight is greater

                               than kero1 and the calculation of percent
                               Laily Value yields a value that is less
                               than 1 percent. The agency believes that

                                a parallel change in y101.9(d)(l)(ii) for
                               foods in conventional food form is





          appropriate. The agency intends to
          propose this change in the near future.
          Additionally1 the agency notes that1

          consistent with y101.9(d)(l)(ii)1 as
          modiffled in the technical amendments

          (3W Fh 44003 at 440111 August 1W1
          1993)1 it is modifying y101.30(b)(4)(i) to

          specify that the percent of Laily Value
          shall be calculated by dividing either the
          amount declared on the label for each

          nutrient or the actual amount of each
          nutrient (i.e.1 before rounding) by the

          hLl or LhV for the speciffled nutrient       .
          and multiplying by 100. The agency ls

          maying this change to provide for
          consistency on the food label between the
          percent Laily Value and the quantitative

          amount by weight. The agency had
          previously provided only that the amount

          declared be used in the calculation.
          2W. One comment requested clarifflcation

          of y101.30(b)(4)(iii)1 which provides that
          when a product is represented or
          purports to be for use by a group other

          than adults and children older than 4
          years of age1 the percent Laily Value for

          each group must be presented in separate
          columns. The comment asyed if the label

          of a product represented for use 44for the
          family:: would have to include
          information for all of the groups for

          which FLA has established hLl:s.
          The agency believes that it is

          appropriate for the label of a product
          represented for use 44for the family:: to

          include information for adults and
          children older than 4 years of age and for

          children younger than 4 years of age
          because families often include children in
          this age group. lnasmuch as there

          generally would be safety concerns in
          feeding infants supplements intended for

          use by adults1 FLA also advises that the
          statement 44for the family:: should be
          modiffled to specifflcally exclude infants if
                                                .
          a fflrm wants to include only a slngle list
          of hLl values. The agency does not

          believe that this comment requires any
          change in the language of the proposed

          rule. Nowever1 the agency advises that
          for clarity1 it has changed the word
           44additional:: in y101.30(b)(4)(iii) to

           44separate.::

                                 29. One comment requested that the fflrst

                                 The agency ls not persuaded that this.

                                 revision is needed. ln proposed y101.30
                                 and in y101.91 the agency has

                                 consistently used the term 44nutrition

                                 3O. One comment requested that y101.30

                                 be revised to clarify that selective reverse

                                 highlighting because it would interfere
                                 with the 44consistent:: looy of the label

                                 (30 Fh 2019 at 213W). For the same
                                 reason1 the agency ls not permitting.

                                 reverse printing on the nutrition labels of

                                 minerals. Accordingly1 the agency has
                                 revised the second sentence of

                                 31. One comment stated that labels of

                                 that have a total surface area available to





          bear labeling of 10 or less square inches
          should be exempt from the requirement
           .
          ln y101.30(c)(4) that all information
          within the nutrition label shall have at

          least one point leading (i.e.1 space
          between two lines of text). Other

          comments stated that this provision of
          the proposed rule is appropriate.
                         .
          The agency ls not persuaded that the
          nutrition label on small labels should be

          exempt from the requirement of at least
          one point leading. This requirement is

          much less than that required for foods in
          conventional food form (e.g.1 four point is
          required between nutrients in

           y101.9(d)(l)(ii)(C) and does little more
          than insure that lines of text do not

          touch). As discussed in the nutrition
          labeling proposal for dietary supplements

           (3W Fh 33113 at 33121)1 the agency
          proposed at least one point leading

          because of concerns about legibility. To
          maintain a consistent and distinctive
          format that is legible1 some leading ls     .

          necessary. Accordingly1 FLA is providing
          for the minimal leading of one point in

          the nutrition labeling of dietary
          supplement of vitamins and minerals and

          encourages manufacturers to use more
          leading whenever possible. FLA is not

          maying a similar change for dietary
          supplements of herbs and of other similar

          nutritional substances because comments
          did not demonstrate space concerns with
          those products that would dustify such a

          change.

          Many of the changes in this document
          will help reduce space requirements (e.g.1
          type sike changes). lf a manufacturer

          fflnds that it is still technologically
          infeasible or impracticable to fflt the

          nutrition label on a particular pacyage1 it
          may write to the OMce of Food Labeling

           as provided in y101.30(d)(2).
           32. One comment requested that the

          yerning requirements be deleted1 and
          that instead1 the regulation state that

           44letters should never touchl:: consistent
          with the technical amendments to y101.9

          published on August 1W1 1993 (3W Fh
          44003 at 44003). Another comment
          requested that labels that are less than

           10 square inches should be exempt from
          the requirement in proposed





                                y101.30(c)(3) that all information within
                                the nutrition label shall have type that is

                                yerned (i.e.1 has proximity of placement)
                                no tighter than -4 setting. At least one

                                comment supported this provision of the
                                proposed rule.

                                The agency agrees that the yerning
                                requirements should be made consistent

                                with that for the nutrition labels on
                                pacyages of foods in conventional food

                                form. As pointed out in a similar
                                comment with respect to the labeling of

                                foods in conventional food form (3W Fh
                                44003 at 44003)1 a numeric yerning value

                                (which in effect limits the proximity of
                                one letter to another) has meaning only
                                for a particular type setting system.

                                Each such system has a unique numeric
                                scale1 and1 as a result1 a setting of -4 is

                                meaningless for systems other than the
                                one that FLA used in designlng its .

                                sample labels. The agency acynowledges
                                its error in including a slngle yerning.

                                limit that would be required for all type
                                setting systems. Accordingly1 FLA is

                                revising y101.30(c)(3)1 consistent with
                                y101.9(d)(l)(ii)(L)1 to delete the
                                requirement for a -4 setting and to state

                                that letters should never touch.

                                33. A couple of comments supported the
                                provision in proposed y101.30(c)(O)

                                regarding type sike1 but more than ten
                                comments strongly opposed the
                                provision. The agency proposed to

                                require type sike no smaller than W point
                                for nutrient information within the

                                nutrition label and to allow no smaller
                                than 0 point type for column headings

                                and footnotes. ln addition1 the agency
                                proposed to allow no smaller than 0

                                point type for all of the information
                                within the nutrition label of pacyages

                                having a total surface area available to
                                bear labeling of 40 or less square inches.
                                The comments said that the total surface

                                area available for labeling for most
                                dietary supplements is well under 40

                                square inches. They stated that the
                                proposed 0 point minimum type sike is

                                far too large for many labels to include
                                all of the required nutrition information

                                and to still allow space for the ingredient

          commonly provided on dietary
          supplement labels. To alleviate this

          space problem1 a number of comments
          requested that FLA allow smaller type

          sike. One comment requested a minimum
          type sike of 3.0 point and another 4.0

          point. Nowever1 most of the comments
          suggested a minimum type sike of 4.3

          point1 which they said is consistent with
          the Nonprescription Lrug Manufacturers

          Association (NLMA) Label headability
          Ouidelines used for over-the-counter

          (OTC) drugs.
          The comments were divided about when

          FLA should allow smaller print sike. A
          few comments believed that smaller type
          .
          ls needed on labels having up to 40
          square inches of total surface area. Other

          comments suggested that such type is
          necessary on various-siked labels1 such as

          those with surface areas of less than 231
          131 121 and 10 square inches. Finally1 a

          few comments suggested that the
          regulation should state that type sike

          should be 44as large as possiblel:: or that.
          lt should permit manufacturers to decide

          for themselves.

          labels1 the agency ls persuaded that the 0
          point minimum type sike proposed for

          nutrition labeling information is too large
          for many multivitamin and multimineral

          supplement labels. The agency
          acynowledges that these products often

          have many nutrients to declare in the

          include on the label other information

          food form. Therefore1 FLA is acceptlng
          the recommendation1 supported by the

          NLMA Label headability Ouidelines1
          that 4.3 point minimum type sike be

          allowed on smaller labels. Throughout
          rulemaying to implement the 1990

          amendments1 FLA has responded to
          consumer concerns that the required

          nutrition information be presented in a
          manner that will improve legibility1

          particularly to help older and
          vision-impaired consumers who otherwise

          would be effectively denied access to the





                                nutrition information. because type siKe
                                ls a mador determinant of legibility1 FLA.

                                does not believe type siKes less than 4.3
                                points should be allowed on pacyage

                                labels and encourages manufacturers to
                                use larger type siKe when label space
                                allows.

                                The agency fflnds that this minimum type

                                siKe of 4.3 points is appropriate on
                                pacyages having less than 12 square

                                inches of surface area available to bear
                                labeling. The agency selected less than of
                                12 square inches of area available to bear

                                labeling as a result of its review of the
                                comments and because it promotes

                                consistency within food labeling
                                regulations inasmuch as y101.2(c)(3)(i)

                                uses this pacyage siKe as the standard for.
                                exemptlng small pacyages of foods from
                                type siKe requirements1 and

                                y101.9(d)(13)(i) uses it to differentiate
                                which food pacyages may use a telephone

                                number or address for consumers to use

                                functional equivalent of a nutrition label
                                if no nutrient content or health claims

                                are made on the label. The agency also
                                fflnds that this decision is reasonable
                                considering the practical need for smaller

                                pacyages containing supplements
                                composed of many vitamins and minerals

                                to have smaller print1 and the need for
                                all labels to be as legible as possible.
                                                            .
                                Therefore1 the agency ls modifying
                                y101.30(c)(O) to allow for pacyages that

                                have a total surface area available to
                                bear labeling of less than 12 square
                                inches to use 4.3 point type siKe. FLA is

                                not maying a similar change for dietary
                                supplements of herbs and of other similar

                                nutritional substances because comments
                                did not demonstrate the same space

                                concerns for those products.   .
                                Additionally1 the agency ls correcting

                                y101.30(c)(O) to refer to paragraph (b)(3)
                                instead of to (b)(4) and to refer to
                                paragraph (b)(4) instead of to (b)(4)(ii).

                                There were inadvertent errors in these
                                references in the proposal.

                                FLA advises that under y101.30(g)1
                                dietary supplements of vitamins and

                                minerals may also use all provisions
                                allowed in y101.9(d)(13) to help

                                accommodate the nutrition label on





           small and intermediate-siked pacyages.
           lf1 despite these provisions1 there are still

           pacyages for which there is insuMcient
           area available to print all required

          information1 the agency advises
           manufacturers to write to the OMce of

           Food Labeling1 FLA (NFS-130)1 on a
           case-by-case basis requesting alternative

           means of compliance (e.g.1 reduced type
           sike or leading) in accordance with

           y101.30(d)(2).
           34. One comment requested that all
           upper case lettering be allowed for

           multivitamin and multimineral labels
           that are less than 23 square inches in

           total available surface area to facilitate
           readability. Other comments agreed with

           proposed y101.30(c)(3)1 which requires
           that all information within the nutrition

          label utilike upper and lower case letters.
           ln the technical amendments published

          in the Federal hegister of August 1W1
           19931 the agency modiffled

           y101.9(d)(13)(i)(b) to allow all upper
           case lettering to be used on pacyages of
          food in conventional food form that have

          less than 12 square inches of surface area
           available to bear labeling (3W Fh 44003

           at 44012). To be consistent1 the agency
           has modiffled y101.30(c)(3) to allow

           pacyages of dietary supplements of
           vitamins and minerals that have less
           than 12 square inches of surface area

           available to bear labeling to use all upper
           case lettering. To maximike legibility and

           to preserve the readily identifflable image
           of the nutrition label1 FLA is limiting

           this special provision to small pacyages
           (i.e.1 those with less than 12 square

          inches of surface area) rather than the 23
           square inches requested in the comment.

           33. A few comments suggested ways to
           alleviate space problems other than by
           using a smaller type sike. One comment

           wanted to be able to present the
           nutrition label on any pacyage panel1 to

           use the tabular or linear method of listing
           nutrients1 and to use the abbreviations

           speciffled in y101.9(d)(13)(ii). Another
           comment requested that the entire

          labeling1 not dust the label on the
           primary container1 be allowed to be used
           to relate nutrition information. One

           comment requested that all supplements





                                 with less than 40 square inches of label

                                 space be exempt from having a large
                                 heading entitled 44Nutrition Factsl:: a box

                                 that surrounds the nutrition panel1 and
                                 the lines that separate each individual

                                 nutrient and the headings. Other
                                 comments requested that the
                                 nonfunctional slacy-fflll regulations be

                                 revised to allow containers to be bigger.

                                 The agency notes that y101.30(g)
                                 provides1 in part1 that dietary

                                 functional equivalent of a nutrition label
                                 if no nutrient content or health claims

                                 are made on the label. When foods in
                                 small pacyages either voluntarily or

                                 because of nutrition claims bear nutrition
                                 labeling1 y101.9(d)(13)(i)(b) also allows

                                 the use of smaller type sike than that
                                 required on larger pacyages.

                                 Section 101.9(d)(13)(ii) defflnes an
                                 intermediate-siked pacyage as one that

                                 has a total surface area available to bear
                                 labeling of 40 or less square inches. This

                                 section of the regulations provides several
                                 additional special labeling provisions to

                                 assist manufacturers in ffltting the
                                 required information on both small and

                                 intermediate-siked pacyages. These
                                 provisions1 which can apply to dietary

                                 supplements of vitamins and minerals in
                                 small or intermediate-siked pacyages1

                                 include using speciffled abbreviations and
                                 presenting the required nutrition

                                 information on any label panel.
                                 Additionally1 this section provides for

                                 presenting the required information in a
                                 tabular (i.e.1 horikontal) display or linear

                                 (i.e.1 string) fashion: (l) lf the product
                                 has a total surface available to bear
                                 labeling of less than 12 square inches1 or

                                 (2) if the product has a total surface area





          available to bear labeling of 40 or less

          square inches1 and the pacyage shape or
          sike cannot accommodate a column

          display on any panel. Nutrition
          information may be given in a linear

          fashion only if the label will not
          accommodate a vertical or tabular

          display.
          ln response to the comment requesting

          use of labeling1 not dust the label on the
          primary container1 to convey nutrition

          information1 the agency advises that it
          has traditionally required that all

          required information (e.g.1 the statement
          of identity1 net weight statement1
          .
          lngredient list1 name and place of
          manufacture1 and nutrition information)

          appear on the label of pacyaged foods.
          Labeling1 which includes materials not

          aMxed to the pacyage (such as posters1
          notebooys1 leafflets1 and brochures

          available at the point of purchase)1 may
          become separated from the pacyaged

          food and are inappropriate for the
          delivery of required information.

          Therefore1 FLA concludes that it would
          not be appropriate to grant the request

          in this comment.

          Nowever1 FLA considers outer pacyaging
          that securely encloses a primary

          container and that is not intended to be
          separated from the primary container

          under conditions of retail sale to be the
          equivalent of the product label.

          Therefore1 when a bottle containing a
          dietary supplement in tablet1 granular1 or
          liquid form is placed within a sealed box1

          the required information must be present
          on the outer container where it is

          available to the consumer at the point of
          purchase. While FLA regulations do not

          require that the information be repeated
          on the primary container inside the box1

          the agency encourages manufacturers to
          do so1 so that consumers will have easy

          access to the information once the
          container is removed from the outer box.

          Liyewise1 if supplements are sold in
          sealed pacyaging that provides a

          cardboard display around the primary
          container1 the full display seen by the

          consumer becomes the product label. ln
          these situations1 the required information

          shall be placed on appropriate panels as





                                directed in yy101.1 and 101.21 pertaining

                                to the principal display panel and the
                                information panel1 respectively.

                                lt would not be consistent with section
                                 2(b)(l)(A) of the 1990 amendments to

                                 allow pacyaging with less than 40 square
                                inches of label space to be exempt from

                                graphic requirements such as having the
                                title 44Nutrition Facts:: in the largest
                                print within the nutrition label1 having

                                the required information enclosed within
                                 a box1 and using hairlines to separate

                                nutrients and headings. As stated above1
                                the agency concluded in the mandatory

                                nutrition labeling fflnal rule (3W Fh 2019
                                 at 2130) that if the nutrition label was to

                                be readily observable and
                                comprehensible1 it must be presented in

                                 as consistent a manner as possible from
                                label to label. Thus1 in establishing the

                                requirements for the nutrition label1 the
                                 agency went to great lengths to give the

                                format a distinctive looy (e.g.1 through
                                the use of a prominent heading1
                                highlighting of yey nutrient information1

                                 and enclosure of the information in a
                                box) to facilitate consumer recognition of

                                the label and to encourage use of the
                                information. Consistency of appearance

                                begins to be lost if these graphic elements
                                 are omitted on certain pacyages. Such

                                 action would maye it liyely that some
                                consumers would fail to recognike the

                                nutrition information and to understand
                                the signifflcance of the information that it

                                presented. For this reason1 FLA is not
                                providing the fflexibility requested.

                                Nowever1 the agency has reviewed the
                                format requirements in response to these

                                comments concerned about space
                                problems. To help alleviate space

                                problems1 the agency has concluded that.
                                lt can provide for fflexibility in the

                                placement of the heading1
                                 44y0 Laily Value.:: When a dietary

                                supplement contains less than 3 calories

                                declared. ln this situation1 shown in the
                                sample labels in y101.30(c)(W) of the

                                proposal (3W Fh 33113 at 3312W through
                                 33130)1 the heading 44y0 Laily Value:: is

                                placed to the right and under the bar
                                beneath the heading 44Amount per
                                 Serving.:: because there is suMcient





           space on one line for both headings1 the
           agency ls modifying y101.30(b)(4) to.
                                                  .
           provide that the heading 44y0 Lally

           when calorie information is not required
           to be declared.

           Also1 consistent with provisions in
           y101.9(d)(11)(i) and (ii) that allow lower
                                                           .
           portions of the vertical format to be spllt
           and moved to the contiguous right1 FLA
           .              .
          ls providing ln y101.30(c)(10) that1 if
           space is not adequate to list the required

          information in one vertical list (as shown
          in the sample labels in y101.30(c)(9))1
           the list may be spllt and the lower.

          information moved to the right as long as
           the headings are repeated. The list to

           the right should be set off by a line that
           distinguishes it and sets it apart from the

           nutrients and the percent Laily Value
          information given to the left. A sample
           of this split format is included in

           y101.30(c)(10).
                         .
           The agency ls not convinced by the
           comment that the nonfunctional slacy-fflll
           regulations should be revised to allow

           containers of dietary supplements to be
          larger than otherwise necessary to

           accommodate the labeling requirements.
           As discussed in the fflnal rule on

           nonfunctional slacy-fflll (3W Fh 04123 at
           041341 Lecember 01 1993)1 the agency
           ynows of no reason for treating dietary

           supplements differently from foods in
           conventional food form. ln response to

           this and the other comments suggesting
           ways to alleviate space constraints1 the

           agency advises that many of the changes
           that FLA has made from the proposal
           will help to reduce space requirements

           (e.g.1 reduced type sike requirements on
           pacyages of dietary supplements of

           vitamins and minerals). lf manufacturers
          fflnd that it is still technologically

          infeasible or impracticable to fflt the
           nutrition label on a particular pacyage1
           they may write to the OMce of Food

           Labeling as directed in yy101.9(g)(9) and
           101.30(d)(2). The agency points out that

           any information1 other than the net
           quantity of contents and statement of

          identity1 may be printed parallel to the
           base of a pacyage. Thus1 the nutrition





                                 label may be printed parallel to the base
                                 of a pacyage1 which may provide more

                                 space for this information. Nowever1
                                 FLA urges manufacturers to strive for

                                 consistency of presentation of nutrition
                                 information in the maryet.

                                 hairlines be required to separate lines of

                                 nutrient declarations1 and that these
                                 hairlines be centered between the lines of

                                 text. This comment also requested

                                 As discussed in the nutrition labeling

                                 proposal for dietary supplements (3W Fh
                                 33113 at 33110)1 the agency intends that

                                 the nutrition labeling on vitamin or
                                 mineral supplements be presented in a

                                 manner that is as similar as possible to
                                 the nutrition labeling of foods in
                                 conventional food form. Nairlines are

                                 required in the nutrition labeling of foods
                                 ln conventional food form as speciffled in.

                                 y101.9(d)(l)(v). The agency intended
                                 that y101.30 contain a similar provision.

                                 Nowever1 it inadvertently failed to
                                 specifflcally provide for hairlines in the

                                 proposed rule1 although it included
                                 hairlines in the samples labels presented
                                 ln proposed y101.30(c)(9) and urged that.

                                 the graphic specifflcations set forth in
                                 Appendix b to part 101 be followed.

                                 These graphic specifflcations describe the
                                 use of hairlines under C-2. Accordingly1

                                 the agency concludes that it is
                                 appropriate to modify y101.30(c) to

                                 require hairlines in y101.30(c)(l) and to
                                 redesignate paragraphs (c)(l) and (c)(W)

                                 as paragraphs (c)(W) and (c)(9)1
                                 respectively1 to refflect this modifflcation.

          the calorie statement1 when the listing of
          calories is required.::

          With respect to Appendix b1 the
          comment is correct in stating that

          Appendix b contains several nonrequired
          elements1 such as Nelvetica typeface1 a

          speciffled type sike for the title 44Nutrition
          Factsl:: and a specifflc thicyness for the

          separating bars on the nutrition label.
          The required graphic elements are

          speciffled in y101.30(b) and (c).
          3l. A couple of comments obdected to

          the bar at the bottom of the nutrition
          label and requested that this requirement

          be deleted. They stated that it is
          unnecessary and may interfere with the
          scanning of the UpC symbol. Another

          comment requested that y101.30(c) be
          revised to require a bar following the

          fflnal vitamin or mineral listed. Other
          comments supported the proposal.

          ln y101.30(b)(3)(ii)1 FLA proposed to
          require a bar at the bottom of the

          nutrition label of dietary supplements of
          vitamins and minerals to help ensure

          that the nutrition label on these types of
          foods has the same readily identifflable
          image1 or 44looyl:: as the nutrition label

          on foods in conventional food form (3W
          Fh 33113 at 33119). Comments to the

          agency:s proposed rule on the format for
          nutrition labeling (31 Fh 3203W1 'uly 201

           1992) had argued that a consistent looy
          to the required nutrition information on

          food pacyages will help consumers fflnd
          the information on the pacyage and to

          recognike it for what it is a profflle of the
          nutrient content of the food. These

          comments convinced FLA that the
          specifflc format elements mandated
          provide a visually integrated image that

          will give the nutrition label a uniform
          appearance across the various types of

          pacyages in the maryet and will enhance
          consumer use of the information.

          Nothing in the comments on proposed
           y101.30 provide the basis for a different

          conclusion. FLA fflnds that contrary to
          the comments: assertion1 this bar
          contributes directly to the consistent

          looy of the nutrition label. To avoid any
          possible interference of the bar at the

          bottom of the nutrition label with the
          scanning of the UpC symbol1





                                manufacturers may design the pacyage
                                layout so that the UpC symbol is not

                                addacent to the nutrition label.
                                Accordingly1 the agency ls not modifying.

                                y101.30(b)(3)(ii) in response to these
                                comments.

                                3W. One comment requested that bars be
                                required after 44Serving Sike:: and

                                 44Amount per Serving.::
                                The agency points out that y101.30(b)(3)

                                requires that the heading 44Amount per
                                Serving:: be separated from other

                                information on the label by a bar above
                                and beneath it. Thus1 the upper bar will

                                be beneath the declaration of 44Servings
                                per Container:: or1 when 44Servings per

                                Container:: is not required1 of 44Serving
                                Sike.:: The lower bar would separate the
                                declaration 44Amount per Serving:: from

                                the heading 44percent Laily Value.:: The
                                agency notes that this bar should follow

                                information on calories1 when that
                                information is declared (i.e.1 when the

                                dietary supplement of vitamins and
                                minerals contains 3 or more calories)1 to

                                be consistent with the labeling of foods
                                ln conventional food form (y101.9(d)(O))..

                                Nowever1 the agency inadvertently failed
                                to specify in the proposed rule where this

                                bar should be placed. As discussed in the
                                nutrition labeling proposal for dietary
                                supplements (3W Fh 33113 at 33110)1 the

                                agency intended that the nutrition
                                labeling on vitamin and mineral

                                supplements be presented in a manner as
                                similar as possible to the nutrition

                                labeling of foods in conventional food
                                form. Therefore1 FLA fflnds that it is the

                                logical outgrowth of the proposal to
                                specify in this fflnal rule where the bar

                                following 44Amount per Serving:: should
                                be placed when information on calories is
                                declared in a nutrition label for a dietary

                                supplement of vitamins or minerals.
                                Accordingly1 the agency ls modifying.

                                y101.30(b)(3) to state: 44The heading
                                ::Amount per Serving :: shall be

                                separated from other information on the
                                label by a bar above and beneath it1

                                except when calories are listed1 the bar
                                shall be placed beneath the calorie

                                declaration.::
                                E. Compliance and Exemption lssues

                                39. At least three comments requested





          that dietary supplements be able to
          indicate compliance with United States
                         .
          pharmacopela (USp) requirements. One
          of these comments requested that a new

          paragraph1 y101.30(d)(3)1 be added that
          would provide that the label could bear a
          box entitled 44Nutrition Facts:: that

          would contain nutrition information for
          USp recogniked substances that are the

          source of vitamins and minerals.
          lmmediately below that box1 the label

          would bear another section entitled1
           44Other lngredients:: that would list all

          additional ingredients present in more
          than insignifflcant amounts1 followed by a
          listing of all other added substances

          incorporated in the product as excipients.
          The comment stated that by listing all

          other ingredients present1 consistency
          with section 411(b)(2)(A)(i) of the act

          would be achieved. Alternatively1 this    .
          comment requested that the followlng

          sentence be added after the fflrst sentence
          of y101.30(d)(2): 44Such allowances will
          also be considered where a fflrm produces

          an article that purports to comply with
          the requirements of the oMcial USp and

          seeys to label it in accordance with the
          requirements of the pharmacopeia.:: The

          comment stated that this new sentence
          would allow fflrms to comply with USp

          labeling requirements with FLA:s
          permission. Additionally1 this comment
          requested that the name of products that

          meet USp quality standards be followed
          by the letters 44USp.::

          both of the comment:s suggested changes

          in y101.30(d) would allow for two very
          different forms of nutrition labeling on

          dietary supplements of vitamins and
          minerals1 depending upon whether a
          manufacturer chose to follow FLA:s

          requirements1 which are generally
          consistent with y101.91 or USp:s1 which

          would list only USp recogniked nutrients
          in the top box. A manufacturer:s

          decision to follow the USp approach
          would result in a nutrition label that was

          inconsistent with labels of other dietary
          supplements of vitamins and minerals1
          with dietary supplements of herbs and

          other similar nutritional substances1 and
          with foods in conventional food form.

          The comment also appears to request





                                that the determination of whether or not
                                a nutrient should be listed in the

                                nutrition label should be based upon its
                                USp status.

                                FLA fflnds that it would not be consistent
                                with section 2(b)(l)(A) of the 1990

                                amendments to provide the fflexibility
                                sought by these comments. As discussed
                                .
                                ln response to earlier comments1 the
                                agency decided in the mandatory

                                nutrition labeling fflnal rule that if the
                                nutrition label was to be readily

                                observable and comprehensible1 it must
                                be presented in as consistent a manner as
                                possible from label to label. Thus1 it was

                                the agency:s determination that1
                                whenever possible1 nutrition labeling

                                requirements should ensure a distinctive
                                looy and order of nutrients to facilitate

                                consumer recognition and understanding
                                of the label and to encourage use of the
                                                       .
                                information. Allowlng two different
                                nutrition labeling schemes would maye it

                                liyely that some consumers would fail to
                                recognike the nutrition information or
                                would be too confused to be able to use

                                it fully. FLA has made the same decision
                                with respect to dietary supplements and

                                thus is not providing the fflexibility
                                requested. Nowever1 in regard to the

                                request that the name of ingredients of
                                USp quality be allowed to indicate USp

                                status1 the agency advises that although
                                statements appearing outside of the
                                nutrition label are beyond the scope of

                                this fflnal rule1 it would not obdect to the
                                use of truthful and nonmisleading

                                statements regarding USp status
                                elsewhere on product labels. Further1

                                FLA would not obdect to the use of the
                                USp symbol in the ingredient list to

                                identify those ingredients that are USp
                                grade. The agency advises that it will
                                not consider the USp symbol1 when used

                                in this way1 to constitute intervening
                                material in the ingredient list.

                                4O. One comment requested that FLA

                                recognike USp methodology. This
                                comment stated that y101.30(d)(l)
                                requires that dietary supplements comply

                                with y101.9(g)(2)1 which speciffles
                                Association of OMcial Analytical

                                Chemists (AOAC) test methodology for
                                nutrient analysls..





          The agency wishes to clarify that
          y101.9(g)(2) states that when FLA

          determines compliance1 it will analyke
          composite samples by appropriate
          methods as given in the 44OMcial
                                 .

          AOAC method is available or
          appropriate1 by other reliable and

          appropriate analytical procedures.
          Manufacturers1 however1 are free to use

          whatever methodology they believe will
          give results consistent with methods used
          by FLA. Therefore1 the requested change
          .
          ls unnecessary.

          4l. One comment requested that the
          compliance criteria be revised to allow
          the actual content of any vitamin or

          mineral in a dietary supplement to be 90
          percent1 instead of at least 100 percent1

          of the declared value. This comment
          stated that the proposed rule (i.e.1

          y101.30(d)(l)1 which refers to
          y101.9(g)(l) through (g)(2)) requires
          that products that contain added

          vitamins and minerals provide at least
          the amount declared for each nutrient.

          The comment stated that consideration
          should be given to the fact that many

          dietary supplements1 while formulated to
          contain at least 100 percent of the
          declared amount1 are designed to retain

          only at least 90 percent of their declared
          amount over the shelf life declared on

          these products. The comment attributed
          this practice to the fact that USp

          monographs for several nutritional
          products require a minimum nutrient

          content of 90 percent of the label
          declaration.
                         .
          The agency ls not persuaded by this
          comment. As previously discussed in

          response to a similar comment in the
          mandatory nutrition labeling fflnal rule
          (3W Fh 2019 at 2111)1 dietary

          supplements of vitamins and minerals are
          fabricated products. The comments

          provided no convincing reason for why
          they should not be held to the same

          standards as foods in conventional food
          form that are fortiffled or enriched. The
          agency has informed USp that anything

          less than 100 percent of the value
          declared on the label for vitamin and

                                deviation from this requirement would be
                                a deviation that is attributable to the

                                variability of the analytical method (hef.

                                revised to either delete the nutrition

                                only those nutrients actually present in
                                the supplement.

                                The agency believes that this comment
                                misunderstood the proposed rule. As the

                                comment requested1 the agency requires
                                nutrition labeling 44only with respect to

                                those substances actually contained in
                                the supplement.:: Manufacturers are not

                                burdened with the cost of declaring that
                                a vitamin supplement contains no fat1 no

                                protein1 or no carbohydrate if they do

                                under y101.30(b)(3). Therefore1 the
                                agency ls not changing the regulation in.

                                response to this comment.
                                FLA notes that Congress recently

                                passed1 and the president signed on
                                August 131 19931 the Nutrition Labeling

                                and Education Act Amendments of 1993
                                (pub. L. 103-WO) that modiffled the

                                treatment of small businesses. As a





          result of this change1 the exemption from
          nutrition labeling requirements for small
          businesses that are food manufacturers

          will be based on the number of employees
          ln a fflrm and the number of units of each.

          product sold. FLA expects to publish a
          proposal to amend yy101.9 and 101.30 to

          refflect the new law.
          F. Misbranding

          43. One comment stated that
          y101.9(y)(l) through (y)(O) should not

          apply to dietary supplements. The
          comment stated that y101.9(y)(l) is
          overbroad such that it suppresses

          truthful1 nonmisleading speech about the
          benefflcial properties of a nutrient

          supplement product that may1 by virtue
          of the supplement:s inherent properties1

          not only be a food but also aid in the
          prevention1 cure1 mitigation1 or treatment
          of any disease. This comment did not

          focus on why y101.9(y)(2) through (y)(O)
          should not apply to dietary supplements.

          Other comments specifflcally mentioned
          that the fflrst sentence of y101.9(y)(3) is
          vague1 confusing1 and contradictory. This

          sentence provides that a food shall be
          deemed to be misbranded if its label or

          labeling represents1 suggests1 or implies
          that the food has dietary properties

          when such properties are of no signifflcant
          value or need in human nutrition. These
          comments suggested that this sentence

          be revised to read: 44A food shall be
          deemed to be misbranded if its label

          claims or represents that the food has a
          signifflcant value or need in human

          nutrition when the scientifflc evidence for
          the claim does not exist.:: These
          comments argued that this change is

          necessary because 44signifflcant value or
          need in human nutrition:: is a matter of

          consumer perception. They said that to
          a small child1 the need for eating spinach
          ls very low1 but to the mother the need.

          for spinach is very high. Other comments
          specifflcally agreed that y101.9(y) should

          apply to dietary supplements of vitamins
          and minerals.

          The agency does not agree with the
          comment that y101.9(y)(l) through

          (y)(O) should not apply to dietary
          supplements1 or that y101.9(y)(l)
          suppresses truthful1 nonmisleading





                                speech. The comment did not provide
                                any basis for the agency to conclude that

                                this provision is not applicable to dietary
                                supplements1 or that it suppresses

                                truthful1 nonmisleading speech.
                                ln the fflnal rule on nutrition labeling of

                                'anuary 01 1993 (3W Fh 2019 at 2101)1
                                the agency pointed out that the
                                provisions of y101.9(i) (redesignated as

                                (y)) had long been in effect at the time
                                Congress drafted the 1990 amendments.

                                While Congress did enact provisions
                                under the 1990 amendments that allow

                                for health claims on foods1 nothing in the
                                act or in the legislative history of the act

                                suggest that Congress intended that
                                y101.9(i) should be changed.
                                Nor did the comments present any

                                persuasive arguments that y101.9(y)(3)
                                of the proposed rule should be amended.

                                The agency does not agree that whether
                                or not a signifflcant value or need in

                                human nutrition has been established is a
                                matter of consumer perception. The

                                agency notes that the phrase 44signifflcant
                                value or need in human nutrition:: was
                                promulgated and published in the

                                Federal hegister of 'anuary 191 1913 (3W
                                Fh 2123). ln that fflnal rule (3W Fh 2123

                                at 212W)1 the agency explained that over
                                the years there have been a number of
                                .

                                .
                                ln human nutrition1 such as rutin1 other
                                biofflavonoids1 para-aminobenkoic acid1

                                and inositol. The agency stated that
                                calling attention to these ingredients in a

                                manner that implies some nutritional
                                benefflt is misleading. The agency

                                concludes that the language of
                                y101.9(y)(3) remains clear and does not
                                need clarifflcation.
                                                           .
                                Therefore1 the agency ls maying no

                                FLA did not receive any comments that
                                dealt specifflcally with the other

                                provisions of the proposal. ln the absence
                                of any basis for doing otherwise1 FLA is

                                ln its dietary supplement labeling





          proposals of 'une 1W1 19931 FLA stated
          that the proposed rules on the labeling of

          dietary supplements1 tayen as a whole1
          would have associated costs of

          approximately t20 million. Thus1 the
          agency concluded that the proposed rules

          do not constitute a mador rule as defflned
          by Executive Order 12291. ln accordance

          with the hegulatory Flexibility Act
          (pub. L. 9O-334)1 FLA explored whether

          the proposed rules may have a signifflcant
          impact on small businesses and
          tentatively concluded that they do not.

          FLA has evaluated the many comments

          that it received in response to its.
          economic impact analysls. because the
          issues raised in the comments relate to

          all three proposals1 FLA has combined
          its discussion of these comments and

          presented them in the fflnal rule regarding
          a delay in the date of application1 which
          .
          ls published elsewhere in this issue of the
          Federal hegister .

          FLA has examined the economic
          implications of the fflnal rules amending

          21 CFh as required by Executive Order
          12W00 and the hegulatory Flexibility

          Act. Executive Order 12W00 directs
          agencies to assess all costs and benefflts of

          available regulatory alternatives and1
          when regulation is necessary1 to select
          regulatory approaches that maximike net

          benefflts (including potential economic1
          environmental1 public health and safety
                                                      .
          effects; distributive impacts; and equlty).
          The hegulatory Flexibility Act requires

          that the agency analyke options for
          regulatory relief for small businesses.

          FLA has concluded1 based on its review
          of the available data and comments1 that

          these fflnal rules are not signifflcant as
          defflned by Executive Order 12W00.
          Further1 in accordance with the

          hegulatory Flexibility Act1 the agency
          certiffles that these fflnal rules will not

          have a signifflcant impact on a substantial
          number of small businesses.

          Vl. Environmental lmpact
          The agency has determined under 21

          CFh 23.24(a)(11) that this action is of a
          type that does not individually or

          cumulatively have a signifflcant effect on
          the human environment. Therefore1

          neither an environmental assessment nor





                               an environmental impact statement is

                               required.

          l. hegulatory Nistory
          On November W1 19901 president bush

          signed into law the Nutrition Labeling
          and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990

          amendments) (pub. L. 101-333). The
          1990 amendments revised the Federal
          Food1 Lrug1 and Cosmetic Act (the act)
          .
          ln a number of important ways. One of
          the most notable aspects of the 1990
          amendments is that they establish FLA:s

          authority to regulate nutrient content
          claims on food labels and in food

          labeling. Section 403(r)(l)(A) of the act1
          which was added by the 1990
          amendments1 provides that a product is





                                misbranded if it bears a claim in its label
                                or labeling that either expressly or
                                implicitly characterikes the level of any

                                nutrient of the type required to be
                                declared as part of nutrition labeling1

                                unless such claim has been specifflcally
                                defflned (or otherwise exempted) by

                                regulation. The 1990 amendments also
                                direct the Secretary and1 by delegation1
                                FLA to promulgate regulations to defflne

                                specifflc nutrient content claims including

                                3(b)(l)(A)(iii) of the 1990 amendments).

                                ln the Federal hegister of November 211
                                 1991 (30 Fh 00421 and 30 Fh 0041W)1

                                FLA published two documents in which.
                                lt proposed1 among other things1 to
                                defflne nutrient content claims1 to provide

                                for their use on foods labels1 and to
                                establish procedures for the submission

                                and review of petitions regarding the use
                                of specifflc nutrient content claims. These
                                proposals applied to dietary supplements

                                as well as foods in conventional food
                                form.

                                On October 01 19921 the president signed
                                the Lietary Supplement Act of 19921

                                Title ll of pub. L. 102-311 (the LS act).
                                Section 202(a)(l) of the LS act

                                established a moratorium on the
                                implementation of the 1990 amendments
                                with respect to dietary supplements until

                                Lecember 131 1993. Section 202(a)(2)(A)
                                required the Secretary1 and by delegation

                                FLA1 to issue proposed regulations on
                                nutrient content claims for dietary
                                supplements no later than 'une 131 1993.

                                FLA issued fflnal regulations that
                                implemented the 1990 amendments with

                                respect to nutrient content claims on
                                foods in conventional food form on

                                'anuary 01 1993 (hereinafter referred to

                                these fflnal regulations slightly in a
                                document that made technical

                                corrections to them (3W Fh 440201
                                August 1W1 1993) (hereinafter referred to

                                ln response to the requirements of the

                                LS act1 FLA published in the Federal
                                hegister of 'une 1W1 1993 (3W Fh 33131)
                                a proposal to: (l) lnclude dietary





          supplements under the coverage of the
          general principles for nutrient content

          claims; (2) provide for the use of
          expressed and implied nutrient content

          claims on labels or in labeling of dietary
          supplements; and (3) provide for

          petitions for nutrient content claims for
          dietary supplements (hereinafter referred

          to as the 44proposal on nutrient content
          claims for dietary supplements::).

          FLA received approximately 300 letters
          ln response to its 'une 1W1 19931 proposal.

          on nutrient content claims for dietary
          supplements. Each letter contained one

          or more comments. The letters were
          from a wide range of sources1 including

          consumers; consumer organikations;
          professional associations; Federal1 State1

          and local government agencies; industry;
          and industry trade associations. Many
          comments generally supported the

          proposal or various provisions of the
          proposal. Other comments addressed

          issues outside the scope of the proposal
          (e.g.1 freedom of choice1 access to health

          care1 access to dietary supplements) and
          will not be discussed here. Many

          comments suggested modifflcations1
          revisions1 or revocations of various

          aspects of the proposal. A summary of
          the comments1 the agency:s responses to

          the comments1 and a complete discussion
          of the agency:s conclusions with respect
          to nutrient content claims for dietary

          supplements follows.

          ll. Nutrient Content Claims for Lietary
          Supplements FLA Authority

          1. A couple of comments contended that
          FLA lacys the statutory authority to

          prohibit claims for substances for which
          no reference value (i.e.1 heference Laily
                                  .
          lntaye (hLl) or Lally heference Value
          (LhV)) has been established. The
          comments also stated that the agency

          lacys legal authority to promulgate
          regulations governing products bearing a

          nutrient content claim for a nutrient or
          other substance not explicitly named in

          section 403(q)(l) or (q)(2) of the 1990
          amendments. The comments said that

          the references to section 403(q)(l) or
          (q)(2) of the act are references to those

          nutrients that the 1990 amendments
          require to be listed (44mandatory





                                 nutrients::) on the nutrition label. The
                                 comments argued that under these
                                 provisions1 a food may be subdect to a

                                 misbranding charge under section
                                 403(r)(l) of the act only if it

                                 characterikes1 either explicitly or

                                 that a food intended for human
                                 consumption is misbranded if it bears a

                                 claim may be made in accordance with
                                 section 403(r)(3)(L) as well as section

                                 403(r)(3). Thus1 because a statute must
                                 be read as a whole1 the language in





           section 403(r)(l)(A) and (r)(l)(b) of the
           act that describes the substances that
           may be the subdect of a nutrient content

           or of a health claim must be read in
           condunction with section 403(r)(3)(L)1

           which addresses health claims for
           vitamins1 minerals1 herbs1 or other

           similar nutritional substances that are
           components of dietary supplements.
           Thus1 the 44nutrients of the type required

           by paragraph (q)(l) or (q)(2):: that are
           the subdect of sections 403(r)(l)(A) and

           (r)(l)(b) of the act include vitamins1
           minerals1 herbs1 and other similar
           nutritional substances.

           The legislative history of 44other
           nutritional substances:: reveals that its

           coverage is broad and could1 in
           appropriate circumstances1 include garlic.

           See 130 Cong. hecord S10009 (daily ed.
           October 241 1990) (discussion between

           Senators Metkenbaum and Symms).
           Therefore1 while a label claim that a food
           contains garlic that is intended to

           describe the taste of the food would not
           be subdect to section 403(r)(l)(A) of the

           act1 a claim that describes the garlic
           content in a way that reveals that garlic
           is being referred to as a nutritional

           substance would be subdect to that
           section. Under section 403(r)(l)(A) of

           the act1 the latter claim would misbrand
           the food unless its use has been

           authoriked by FLA under section
           403(r)(2). Thus1 FLA redects the
           comments that disagreed with the

           proposed coverage of the nutrient content
           claim provisions.

           FLA has relied on the hLl:s and LhV:s
           in defflning nutrient content claims under

           section 403(r)(2) of the act because it
           has concluded that if the characterikation
           of the level of a nutrient is to have any

           meaning1 there must be a level that can
           be used as a reference in determining

           whether the characterikation is valid and
           appropriate. The hLl:s and LhV:s

           provide such levels. Thus1 in y101.34(a)
           (21 CFh 101.34(a))1 FLA has limited the
           use of 44good sourcel:: 44highl:: and 44more::

                               standards that can be used as reference
                               values to establish the validity of content

                               claims for substances for which hLl:s
                               and LhV:s have not been established1
                               those persons should maye FLA aware of

                               CFh 101.09) or other appropriate means.

                               FLA will carefully consider using such
                               standards as the basis for content claims

                               for the substances involved.

                               comment argued that FLA has chosen to

                               not meaningful to the supplement

                               the comments argued that it is important

                               that the terms used to describe the levels
                               of nutrients in both dietary supplements

                               and foods in conventional food form be
                               consistent. These comments maintained

                               that consumers would be confused if
                               claims were to be allowed on dietary

                               supplements that were not defflned in the
                               same manner as those for foods in

                               conventional food form.
                               FLA disagrees with the comments that

                               said that consistency with established
                               nutrient content claims is inappropriate

                               as a basic principle for defflning nutrient
                               content claims for dietary supplements.
                               There is much about dietary supplements

                               that suggests that the principles that
                               guide FLA in defflning nutrient content

                               claims for dietary supplements should be
                               the same as the principles that guide the

                               agency in defflning nutrient content





          claims on foods in conventional food

          form. Lietary supplements that are not
          intended for use as drugs have

          traditionally been regulated as foods
          and1 as such1 must be evaluated within

          the context of the total daily diet. ln
          addition1 nutrients from dietary

          supplements serve the same physiological
          function as nutrients from foods in

          conventional food form. While some
          consumers seey to ensure that the

          nutrient content of their diet is adequate
          through foods in conventional food form1

          other consumers seey to ensure
          nutritional adequacy by maying dietary

          supplements part of their diets (hef. 1).
          Consistent use of terms on dietary
          supplements and on foods in conventional

          food form will thus help consumers to
          construct a nutritionally adequate total
                                .
          daily diet by allowlng consumers to maye
          meaningful comparisons among these

          products. lt will also facilitate use of
          these terms by consumers.

          Over the years1 FLA has stressed the

          importance of consistent defflnitions and
          descriptive terms as a necessary

          requirement for effective education and
          for preventing misleading labeling (hef.

          2). lf terms were given different
          defflnitions depending on whether they

          were to be used to describe foods in
          conventional food form or dietary

          supplements1 it would maye it much
          more diMcult for the public to

          understand what these terms are
          intended to convey about a particular
                                  .
          food. Moreover1 a slngle defflnition for a
          particular term eliminates any possibility
          that ambiguities could be created by the

          use of that term. Therefore1 the agency
          concludes that for nutrient content

          claims1 the defflnition of a particular term
          should be the same regardless of the type

          of food that it is being used to describe.

          Additionally1 FLA has been criticiked for
          treating dietary supplements differently

          than other foods. FLA has no desire to
          discriminate in any way against

          supplements. Thus1 by having a single
          defflnition for a particular nutrient

          content claim1 FLA is providing the basis
          for dietary supplements to maye the

          same claims as other foods and to be





                                 factored into the diet liye other foods.

                                 Nonetheless1 as discussed in the proposal
                                 on nutrient content claims for dietary

                                 supplements (3W Fh 33131)1 FLA
                                 recognikes that dietary supplements

                                 differ in at least two respects from foods.
                                 ln conventional food form. First1 dietary

                                 supplements are liyely to contain much
                                 higher levels of nutrients than foods in

                                 conventional food form. Thus1 additional
                                 nutrient content claims that are specifflc
                                 for dietary supplements may be

                                 appropriate. As discussed later in this
                                 document1 the agency intends in the near

                                 future to initiate a separate rulemaying
                                 to establish such claims for dietary

                                 supplements. Second1 dietary
                                 supplements generally do not contain

                                 several nutrients (e.g.1 fat1 cholesterol)
                                 found in foods in conventional food form.

                                 Therefore1 in this document1 FLA is
                                 limiting the use of certain claims that are

                                 useful for describing foods in
                                 conventional food form but that do not

                                 meaningfully describe dietary
                                 supplements.

                                 that FLA was never given the authority

                                 to decide on formulations of dietary
                                 supplements1 and that setting such

                                 stated that there is nothing 44imitation::
                                 about 44less:: in the supplement industry1

                                 and that a requirement that a
                                 supplement be labeled 44imitation:: if it is

                                 nutritionally inferior to another product
                                 forces manufacturers to increase
                                 potencies in order that their products

                                 will not have to be labeled 44imitation.::

                                 Under section 403(r)(2)(A)(ii) of the act1
                                 for a food to be labeled as 44Snutrient]

                                 present in the food or in a food for which
                                 lt substitutes1 as that term is defflned by.

                                 the Secretary (and by delegation1 FLA)
                                 for the food. Accordingly1 the agency

                                 defflned 44substitute foods:: in y101.13(d)





           (21 CFh 101.3(d)) in the fflnal rule on

           nutrient content claims (3W Fh 2302 at
           2411) for the purpose of identifying the
           characteristics that substitute foods must

           have if they are to bear nutrient content
           claims that highlight differences between

           them and the foods for which they
           substitute. The defflnition states that a

           substitute food is one that may be used
           interchangeably with another food that it

           resembles1 i.e.1 to which it is
           organoleptically1 physically1 and

           functionally (including shelf life) similar
           and to which it is not nutritionally

           inferior1 unless it is labeled as an
           44imitation.:: Additionally1 y101.3(e)(l)

           (21 CFh 101.3(e)(l)) states that a food
           shall be deemed to be an imitation1 and
           thus subdect to the requirements of

           section 403(c) of the act1 if it is a
           substitute for or resembles another food

           but is nutritionally inferior to that food.
           Thus1 the issue that the agency must

           consider is whether dietary supplements
           that are foods should be subdect to these

           provisions on substitute foods as any
           other foods are.

           The agency has no evidence that

           manufacturers will increase the potencies
           for their products to avoid the use of this

           term and disagrees that this provision
           will interfere with a manufacturer:s right
           to decide on product formulations. lt is

           extremely unliyely that the term
           44imitation:: will ever be used on dietary

           supplements1 particularly dietary
           supplements of vitamins and minerals.

           The issue of whether a supplement would
           be an 44imitation:: would arise only when

           a manufacturer chooses to maye a 44free::
           or 44low:: claim for sugar or sodium on a

           dietary supplement (see comment 4). ln
           such circumstances1 under section

           403(r)(2)(A)(ii) of the act1 the
           manufacturer must identify a product on

           the maryet with which its product can be
           used interchangeably1 to which the
           manufacturers product is not

           nutritionally inferior1 and that contains
           sodium or sugar. Such a product may

           include the version of the manufacturer:s
           product that contains sodium or sugar.

           As long as such a product exists1 the
           manufacturer:s product need not be





                                labeled as an imitation. Moreover1 if

                                because of the way the manufacturer has
                                formulated its product1 there is no

                                product with which it is used
                                interchangeably1 the product can be

                                called 44                 1 a sodium-free
                                food.:: Only in the rare situations in

                                which neither of the conditions apply
                                would the product have to be called

                                 44imitation:: for it to bear a 44free:: or
                                 44low:: sodium or sugar claim.

                                Sections 101.13(d)(l) and (d)(2) are
                                designed to ensure that material

                                differences between the substitute food
                                and the reference food are conspicuously

                                stated on the label or labeling of the
                                food1 so that consumers can maye fully

                                informed dudgments about the value of
                                the substitute food and its usefulness in

                                maintaining healthy dietary practices. lf
                                a product has substantially less of a

                                nutrient than the reference food1 and to
                                that extent is materially different and

                                inferior in nutrient content1 then
                                 44imitation:: is an entirely appropriate

                                term. For this reason1 the agency
                                concludes that there is no reason to

                                apply the substitute food provisions any
                                differently to dietary supplements than

                                to other foods.

                                Claims

                                4. Several comments from dietary
                                supplement manufacturers and trade

                                associations questioned the need to allow
                                 44low:: and 44free:: claims for nutrients

                                such as fat and cholesterol that are not
                                typically found in dietary supplements.

                                One comment suggested that 44freel::
                                 44lowl:: and 44reduced:: claims for calories1

                                fat1 and cholesterol on dietary
                                supplements should be permitted only on

                                dietary supplements that are a signifflcant
                                source of calories1 such as protein

                                supplements. The comment argued that
                                consumers do not expect most dietary

                                supplements to contain signifflcant
                                amounts of calories1 and that it is
                                nonsensical and confusing to permit

                                dietary supplements that are not a
                                signifflcant source of calories to maye a

                                claim about reduced amounts of calories1
                                fat1 and cholesterol contained therein.

                                Another comment stated that Americans





          who consume dietary supplements do not
          do so because the products are 44low in

          fatl:: 44cholesterol freel:: or 44low caloriel::
          and that consumers are not interested in

          the fat content of dietary supplements.
          The comment argued that consumers

          care about the substances in the
          products and the benefflts that those

          products can have for their health.
          ln the proposal on nutrient content

          claims for dietary supplements1 the
          agency requested comment on the need

          for extending 44freel:: 44lowl:: and
           44reduced:: claims to dietary supplements

           (3W Fh 33131 at 33143). The agency has
          reviewed the comments that it received

          and is persuaded by them that it not
          meaningful to allow claims about the

          calorie1 fat (including saturated fat)1 or
          cholesterol content of most dietary
          supplements. Most of these products do

          not contain those nutrients1 and most
          consumers do not expect that they do.

          Thus1 consumers would not generally
          looy to these products in maying dietary

          choices that are designed to control the
          amount of calories1 fat1 saturated fat1

          and cholesterol in the foods they eat. ln
          fact1 claims about these nutrients in most

          dietary supplements would only serve to
          confuse consumers. While it is true that

          FLA is requiring information about these
          nutrients in the nutrition label of
          supplements of herbs and of other similar

          nutritional substances1 this requirement
          derives mainly from the limitation on the

          exemption in section 403(q)(3)(F) of the
          act (formerly section 403(q)(3)(E)). See

          the fflnal rule on general requirements for
          nutrition labeling for dietary

          supplements published elsewhere in this
          issue of the Federal hegister .

          Nowever1 the agency recognikes that
          there are some dietary supplements1 such

          as protein supplements1 in which the
          amount of calories in the product is

          signifflcant to consumers. On these
          products1 the source of the calories1

          particularly whether they are from fat1 is
          relevant and useful information.

          Therefore1 FLA has decided1 based on
          the comments that it received to only

          allow calorie1 fat1 saturated fat1 and
          cholesterol claims on those dietary





                                 supplements in which the amount of
                                 calories is important to consumers. ln
                                           .
                                 attemptlng to defflne what this level of
                                 calories should be1 the agency looyed

                                 fflrst to y101.9(f)(l) and (d)(4)1 which
                                 said that a food has 44insignifflcant::

                                 calories for the purposes of nutrition
                                 labeling if it has an amount of calories

                                 that can be rounded to kero. Section
                                 101.9(c)(l) states that 44less than 3
                                 calories:: per serving may be expressed as

                                 kero1 the same amount that is defflned as
                                 44calorie free.::

                                 While FLA does not have information on
                                 the caloric content of dietary

                                 supplements1 it would not be
                                 unreasonable to expect that many

                                 dietary supplements contain more than 3
                                 calories (cal) per serving1 particularly

                                 children:s chewable vitamin and mineral

                                 consumers to bear such claims.

                                 FLA next looyed at the defflnition of
                                 44low calorie:: in y101.00(b)(2) (21 CFh

                                 101.00(b)(2)) for use in determining
                                 which dietary supplements should be
                                 allowed to bear 44freel:: 44lowl:: and

                                 44reduced:: claims. Section 101.00(b)(2)
                                 defflnes a 44low calorie:: food as a food

                                 that contains 40 cal or less per reference
                                 amount customarily consumed

                                 (hereinafter referred to as reference
                                 amount) and per 30 grams (g) if the

                                 reference amount is small. FLA believes
                                 that 40 cal per reference amount

                                 represents a reasonable level for

                                 of calories for dietary supplements. ln a
                                 product that contains this amount of
                                 calories1 the source of the calories (e.g.1

                                 fat) is of signifflcance to consumers.
                                                               .
                                 Accordingly1 the agency ls revising
                                 y101.02(a) (21 CFh 101.02(a)) by adding
                                 paragraph (a)(4) to state that 44freel::





           44lowl:: and 44reduced:: claims for fat1

           saturated fat1 and cholesterol may not be
           made for dietary supplements that meet

           the criteria in y101.00(b)(l) and (b)(2)
           for 44calorie free:: and 44low calorie::
           claims. FLA is also revising y101.13(b)

           by adding new paragraph (b)(3) to
           refflect these provisions. As a

           consequence1 claims that identify all
           products of that class of being 44low:: or

           44free:: of a nutrient (e.g.1   44vitamin C
           supplement1 a fat-free supplement::) will

           also be prohibited.
           Nowever1 to use the same criteria (i.e.1

           that a product may not be 44calorie free::
           or 44low calorie:: ) as a basis for when a

           calorie claim may be made1 has the effect
           of prohibiting the very claims that the

           criterion seeys to permit1 namely 44calorie
           free:: and 44low calorie:: claims. Such a

           criterion would permit only relative
           calorie claims (e.g. 44reduced::) on dietary

           supplements. Therefore1 a slightly
           different scheme for permitting calorie

           claims on certain dietary supplements1
           such as protein supplements1 must be
           derived.

           While1 as stated above1 the agency

           believes that calorie claims should not be
           permitted on most dietary supplements1
           it does believe that 44calorie free:: and

           44low calorie:: claims may be appropriate
           if an equivalent amount of a similar food

           (i.e.1 another protein supplement) that
           the labeled food resembles and for which
           .
           lt substitutes would normally contain an
           appreciable amount of calories. Such a

           claim would highlight that the labeled
           food had a different calorie profflle than

           would be expected in the similar product.
           lt would also serve to direct a consumer

           to a product that had a lower amount of
           calories. because the food would meet

           the criteria for 44low calorie:: and would
           be so labeled1 it would not be necessary

           to highlight any comparative differences
           between the labeled and the similar food

           as would be required for a relative claim.
           Therefore1 the agency ls revising.

           y101.02(a) by adding new paragraph
           (a)(4) to state that claims for calories

           may not be made on labels of dietary
           supplements that meet the criteria in

           y101.00(b)(l) or (b)(2) for 44calorie free::





                                and 44low calorie:: except when an

                                equivalent amount of a similar dietary
                                supplement (e.g.1 another protein

                                supplement) that the labeled food
                                resembles and for which it substitutes

                                normally exceeds the defflnition for 44low
                                calorie:: in y101.00(b)(2). lt is including

                                similar language in y101.13(b)(3).
                                The comments specifflcally obdected to

                                Claims for sodium and sugar content

                                were not mentioned. Since the sugar and
                                sodium levels in dietary supplements can

                                vary substantially1 the agency fflnds that
                                claims about the sugar and sodium

                                content of dietary supplements may be
                                useful in helping consumers to maye

                                purchasing decisions that will assist them.
                                ln maintaining healthy dietary practices.
                                Thus1 extending the defflnitions of 44lowl::

                                 44freel:: and 44reduced:: for sugar and
                                sodium to dietary supplements is

                                appropriate irrespective of the calorie
                                level of the dietary supplement.

                                Therefore1 FLA concludes that there is
                                no need to place limitations on claims for

                                sugar and sodium content other than
                                those in yy101.00(c) and 101.011

                                respectively. As explained below1 FLA is
                                amending these provisions to refflect their

                                application to dietary supplements.
                                3. Labeling Mechanics

                                3. ln discussing type sike for nutrient
                                content claims1 one comment stated that

                                every new statement that is required on
                                dietary supplement labels will create a

                                problem for manufacturers1 particularly
                                if they are constrained by minimum-type
                                sike requirements.

                                The agency acynowledges that dietary

                                supplements are frequently pacyaged in
                                small containers1 and for this reason1

                                FLA specifflcally asyed for information on
                                the impact of the type sike proposal on

                                dietary supplements that are pacyaged in
                                small containers (3W Fh 33131 at 33134).
                                No suggestions or examples were

                                presented to assist the agency in deciding
                                how to address this problem. Therefore1

                                the agency has made no special provision
                                for dietary supplements in the type sike

                                requirements for nutrient content claims.
                                FLA discusses the type sike requirements





           for the nutrition labeling of dietary

           supplements in the fflnal rule on nutrition
           labeling of dietary supplements published
           elsewhere in this issue of the Federal

           hegister .

           FLA stated in the technical corrections
           document (3W Fh 44020 at 44020 and

           44021) that there was a need to specify
           the minimum type sike for labeling
           information (e.g.1 accompanying

           information) required under the nutrient
           content claims regulation. As a result1

           the agency modiffled y101.2(b) to include
           yy101.131 101.341 101.301 101.001 101.011

           101.021 and 101.03 in the list of sections
           set out in y101.2(b) for which a minimum

           type sike for required label information is
           speciffled. For consistency1 the agency

           also modiffled y101.2(f) to include
           yy101.131 101.341 101.301 101.001 101.011

           101.021 and 101.03.The effect of these
           revisions for dietary supplements is that

           label information required by the
           nutrient content claims regulations1 but

           whose type sike is not otherwise speciffled1
           will be required to be in letters or
           numbers no less than one-sixteenth of an

           inch in height unless otherwise speciffled
           by y101.2(c). FLA believes that maying

           nutrient content claims on dietary
           supplements subdect to this requirement
           .
           ls appropriate because this requirement is
           the logical outgrowth of the proposal. ln

           the proposal on nutrient content claims
           for dietary supplements1 FLA raised the

           issue of how to maye nutrient content
           claims on dietary supplements. The

           question of how to ensure the legibility of
           the referral statement1 which is required

           by section 403(r)(2)(b) of the act1 is one
           that is at least implicitly raised by this
           issue. Thus1 the agency:s decision to

           explicitly address the question of the
           type sike of the referral statement in this

           fflnal rule represents the logical outgrowth
           of issues that were raised in the proposal.

           The agency pointed out in the technical
           corrections document that if there are

           circumstances in which the product is
           not able to comply with type sike

           requirements1 manufacturers may request
           an alternative means of compliance (e.g.1

           permission to use a reduced type sike) in
           accordance with y101.9(g)(9). Section





                                 101.9(g)(9) states that when it is not

                                technologically feasible1 or some other
                                circumstance mayes it impracticable1 for

                                fflrms to comply with nutrition labeling
                                requirements1 they may write to the

                                 OMce of Food Labeling1 Food and Lrug
                                Administration1 and request an

                                 alternative means of compliance. For the
                                reasons explained above1 dietary
                                supplements of herbs and other similar

                                nutritional substances are appropriately
                                subdect to this provision even though it

                                was not specifflcally set out in the
                                proposal on nutrient content claims for

                                dietary supplements. A similar provision
                                is included in y101.30(d)(2) of the fflnal

                                regulation for nutrition labeling for
                                dietary supplements of vitamins and

                                minerals1 in a companion document in
                                this issue of the Federal hegister . These

                                provisions allow fflexibility to ensure that
                                there will be either suMcient space to

                                maye nutrient content claims on the
                                labels of dietary supplements1 or that

                                manufacturers will have recourse to
                                request relief.

                                b. Lisclosure levels

                                 0. One comment stated that there are a
                                certain number of products1 such as
                                chewable tablets containing sodium

                                 ascorbate1 for which information on
                                sodium might be useful to consumers in

                                maintaining healthy diets. The comment
                                suggested that the agency urge

                                supplement manufacturers to include
                                information on sodium content1 even

                                though the sodium level might not reach
                                the threshold levels established in

                                 y101.13(h)(l) that would trigger a
                                required statement.

                                The agency disagrees that there is a
                                suMcient basis for requiring either the

                                declaration of total sodium content on
                                the principal display panel of a dietary

                                supplement or for requiring a referral
                                statement directing the consumer to the

                                nutrition label for information about
                                sodium content on all dietary

                                supplements. Section 101.13(h)(l)
                                speciffles that the referral statement (i.e.1

                                 44See Sappropriate panel] for information
                                 about Snutrient requiring disclosure] and

                                other nutrients::) is required only when
                                the sodium (or fat1 saturated fat1 or





          cholesterol) content of a product exceeds

          the disclosure level. FLA fflnds that there.
          ls no reason to provide a different rule for

          dietary supplements.
          To the extent1 as the comment suggests1

          that information on sodium content
          would be useful1 it will be provided on

          the nutrition label as long as it is present
           at more than an insignifflcant level.

           Section 101.30(b)(3)1 which lists the
          nutrients that must be included in the

          nutrition label of a dietary supplement of
           a vitamin or mineral1 provides that all
          nutrients listed in y101.9(c)1 including

          sodium1 must be declared on the
          nutrition label of a dietary supplement of

          vitamins and minerals1 except that
          nutrients present at levels that would be

          declared as kero shall not be declared.
           (For sodium1 the amount that is declared

           as kero is less than 3 milligrams (mg) per
          serving.) Section 101.9(c) itself requires

          that sodium be listed on the nutrition
          label of other dietary supplements.

           Consumers thus will be able to readily
          fflnd the amount of sodium in a product

          by examining the nutrition label.
          because the comment provided no basis

          for its suggestion other than usefulness1
          FLA is not maying any special provision

          for the declaration of sodium on dietary
          supplements.

          4. helative Claims1 heference Foods1
           44Modiffled::

           1. One comment requested that the
           agency clarify in y101.13(d) that for

          dietary supplements1 the reference food
          may be a source of the nutrient in either

           a dissimilar food within a product
          category or a similar food. The comment

          stated that the most helpful information
          to a consumer purchasing a dietary

          supplement often may be a comparison
          of the vitamin or mineral content to a

          recogniked source of the nutrient1 e.g.1
           44contains more vitamin C than two W ok
          glasses of orange duice.:: ln addition1 the

          comment maintained that the examples
          used in the proposed rule on nutrient

          content claims for dietary supplements
           (3W Fh 33131 at 33131) for comparing

          dissimilar foods within the same product
          category (e.g.1 potato chips as a reference

          for pretkels) generally does not apply to





                                 dietary supplements.

                                 The agency agrees that a clarifflcation is
                                 warranted to reinforce that y101.13(d)

                                 applies to dietary supplements as well as
                                 to foods in conventional food form.

                                 Section 101.13(d)(l)(i)(A) states that for
                                 44less:: (or 44fewer::) and 44more:: claims1
                                 the reference food may be a dissimilar

                                 food within a product category that can
                                 generally be substituted for one another

                                 in the diet (e.g.1 potato chips as reference
                                 for pretkels) or a similar food (e.g.1

                                 potato chips as reference for potato
                                 chips).

                                 The agency agrees that adding examples
                                 that are specifflc for dietary supplements

                                 reference food that is a similar food (e.g.1

                                 one brand of multivitamin for another
                                 brand of multivitamin).

                                 W. One comment agreed that the term
                                 44modiffled:: would rarely be a useful term

                                 for vitamin)mineral supplements but
                                 stated that this term might be useful for

                                 certain dietary supplements that contain
                                 44other similar nutritional substances.::

                                 The comment stated that there are
                                 techniques for concentrating certain fflsh

                                 oils that are high in omega-3 fatty acids.
                                 The comment suggested that the use of

                                 the term 44modiffled:: might serve to
                                 distinguish products containing the

                                 concentrated fflsh oils from other fflsh oil
                                 products that would have to be tayen

                                 several times a day to provide the same.
                                 amount of fflsh oll and thus result in the
                                 consumption of signifflcantly more

                                 calories. The comment argued that use
                                 of the term 44modiffled:: on dietary





          supplements should be authoriked to
          maintain the principle of consistency

          between foods in conventional food form
          and dietary supplements.

          The agency agrees. FLA has defflned
          44modiffled:: for use as part of the

          statement of identity on foods to refflect
          the fact that a change has been made in

          a food (30 Fh 00421 at 00434). The
          term is not to be used alone1 nor is the
          term to be used to describe products

          that have not been altered (3W Fh 2302
          at 2301 and 2412). based on the

          comment1 the agency concludes that this
          term may have some limited usefulness

          for dietary supplements1 and thus this
          term may be used on such products when

          they meet the conditions of y101.13(y).
          FLA fflnds1 however1 that no change in
          y101.13(y) is necessary to authorike this

          use of the term.
          3. heference Amounts

          9. One comment stated that if
          comparative claims (e.g.1 44reduced

          sodium::) were to be made for dietary
          supplements1 there need to be reference

          amounts (i.e.1 reference amounts
          customarily consumed) established so

          that one product recommending
          consumption of1 for example1 one
                                         .
          tablespoon (tbsp) per day ls not
          compared to a product recommending

          fflve tbsp per day. The comment argued
          that the proposal allows very fflexible
          reference amounts for supplements (i.e.1

          whatever the manufacturer is
          recommending for consumption) and

          suggests that reference amounts of
          reference foods (as established in

          y101.13(d)) be speciffled in more concrete
          terms.
                        .
          The agency ls not persuaded by the
          comment that more concrete terms are

          needed for reference amounts at this
          time. The agency has established in the
          fflnal rule on general requirements for

          nutrition labeling for dietary
          supplements published elsewhere in this

          issue of the Federal hegister a defflnition
          for the reference amount customarily

          consumed for dietary supplements in
          y101.12(b) as 44the maximum amount

          recommended on the label for
          consumption per eating occasion or1 in





                                the absence of recommendations1 1

                                tablet1 capsule1 pacyet1 or teaspoonful1 as
                                appropriate.:: This defflnition is based on

                                comments received on the proposal for
                                mandatory nutrition labeling for dietary
                                supplements.

                                Section 101.13(p)(l)1 which FLA

                                proposed to apply to dietary
                                supplements1 states that unless otherwise

                                speciffled1 the reference amount
                                customarily consumed set forth in
                                y101.12(b) through (f) shall be used in

                                determining whether a product meets the
                                criteria for a nutrient content claim. The

                                comment did not suggest an alternative
                                to the reference amount that could be

                                used as the basis for comparative claims
                                for dietary supplements. Therefore1 given

                                the fact1 as the agency said in the
                                proposal on nutrient content claims for

                                dietary supplements (3W Fh 33131 at
                                33132)1 that a consistent approach to

                                nutrient content claims on dietary
                                supplements and on foods in conventional

                                to use and understand such claims1 FLA

                                for foods in conventional food form.

                                The agency acynowledges that there is a
                                potential for unfair maryeting and

                                misleading claims if the serving sike is
                                manipulated upwards or downwards to

                                enable a product to maye a nutrient
                                content claim. The agency retains the
                                authority to regulate any such misleading

                                claims under section 403(a) of the act.

                                1O. Many comments stated that limiting

                                nutrient content claims to those nutrients
                                with hLl:s or LhV:s was unnecessarily
                                restrictive. Several comments suggested

                                that content claims should be authoriked
                                with respect to a nutrient as long as it

                                has either an hLl or LhV as established





          by FLA in y101.9(c) or a hecommended

          Lietary Allowance (hLA) as established
          by the National Academy of Sciences

          (NAS) (hef. 4). Other comments also
          stated that nutrient content claims
          should be authoriked for nutrients for

          which NAS has established Estimated
          Safe and Adequate Laily Lietary lntayes

          (ESALLl:s). Other comments suggested
          that FLA should expand the number of
          vitamins and minerals with hLl:s when
          .
          lt publishes the fflnal hLl)LhV rule
          following the expiration of the LS act

          moratorium.
          FLA agrees that the current list of hLl:s

          does not represent the entire list of
          nutrients for which dietary
          recommendations have been established.

          The agency had proposed to establish
          hLl:s for all nutrients for which hLA:s

          or ESALLl:s were provided in the 19W9
          edition of the NAS hLA:s (30 Fh
          00300). Nowever1 under the LS act1 the

          agency was constrained to retain the
          label reference values established in

          y101.9(c)(W)(iv) until at least November
          W1 1993. These values were based on the
          190W hLA:s. The 190W hLA:s did not

          contain recommended dietary values for
          a number of nutrients for which NAS has

          subsequently provided hLA:s or
          ESALLl:s. hLA:s for vitamin K and
          selenium were established subsequent to

          190W and are listed in the 19W9 edition of
          the NAS hLA:s (hef. 4). Furthermore1

          the 19W0 and 19W9 editions of the NAS
          hLA:s provided ESALLl:s for chloride1
          manganese1 ffluoride1 chromium1 and

          molybdenum. Now that the moratorium
          established by the LS act has expired1
                       .
          the agency ls proposing elsewhere in this
          issue of the Federal hegister to establish
          hLl:s for all nutrients for which hLA:s

          or ESALLl:s are provided in the 19W0
          and 19W9 editions of the NAS:s

          hecommended Lietary Allowances but
          for which hLl:s or LhV:s have not been
          established by FLA. Once hLl:s are

          established for these additional seven
          nutrients1 nutrient content claims may be

          made for them.
          FLA intends to consider revising all of

          the hLl:s to conform to the most recent
          levels established by NAS. Nowever1





                                FLA is aware that NAS is in the process

                                of reevaluating the basis on which hLA:s
                                are determined. lt is considering the

                                issue of whether values should be
                                selected to prevent defflciencies or to

                                promote optimal wellness. The agency
                                believes that its action should await

                                completion of the NAS process. FLA is
                                committed to worying with NAS to help

                                resolve this issue.
                                Accordingly1 as stated in response to

                                comment number 1 above1 FLA has
                                concluded that it is not possible to defflne

                                nutrient content claims for nutrients for
                                which no reliable reference standards

                                such as the hLl:s and LhV:s have been
                                established. The agency believes that

                                authorikation for nutrient content claims
                                for nutrients for which no hLl or LhV
                                exists (e.g.1 vitamin K) needs to be

                                deferred until hLl:s or LhV:s are
                                adopted. ln the interim1 quantitative

                                nutrient information may be listed in the
                                nutrition label as discussed in the fflnal

                                rule on general requirements for nutrition
                                labeling for dietary supplements

                                Also1 manufacturers may provide amount
                                or percentage statements as described in

                                y101.13(i)(3) for those nutrients that do
                                not have hLl:s or LhV:s. For example1

                                while there is no hLl for ffluoride1 under
                                this provision1 manufacturers may

                                declare the amount of the nutrient
                                present (e.g.1 2 mg ffluoride) on any panel

                                outside of the Nutrition Facts box.
                                1l. One comment stated that claims

                                should be permitted for beta -carotene.

                                The agency believes that claims
                                regarding beta -carotene (e.g.1 44contains

                                beta -carotene::) are claims about an.
                                lngredient that maye implied

                                representations about the level of
                                vitamin A that is present in the food as
                                beta -carotene. This conclusion is

                                consistent with section 403(r)(l)(A) of
                                the act1 which states that a food can be

                                misbranded by a statement that
                                expressly or by implication characterikes

                                the level of a nutrient in a food. The
                                agency considers that the claim 44contains

                                beta -carotene:: implies that there is
                                enough beta -carotene in the food to





          constitute a 44good source:: of vitamin A
                 .
           (i.e.1 lt contains 10 percent or more of
          the LV for vitamin A from beta

          -carotene). Such a claim is provided for
          ln y101.03(c)..

           12. One comment advocated defflning
          nutrient content claims for ultratrace

          nutrients including boron1 silicon1
          vanadium1 arsenic1 and tln. The.

          comment stated that claims about these
          ultratrace elements should be permitted

          on the basis of the hLA1 ESALLl1 or
          the amounts found in the average

          well-balanced diet. Additionally1 this
          comment argued that reference values

          should be available for ultratrace
          nutrients once reputable scientifflc

          evidence is established that such
          nutrients serve important metabolic or

          physiological functions in the body. The
          comment also suggested that label

          information be permitted for choline and
          inositol.

          The agency disagrees. The trace elements

          arsenic1 nicyel1 silicon1 boron1 cadmium1.
          lead1 lithium1 tln1 vanadium1 and cobalt1
          as well as choline and inositol1 have not

          been shown to be essential in humans.
          No hLA:s or ESALLl:s for these

          substances have been established by
          NAS. NAS states that several of these

          substances 44naturally present in foods
          are ynown to be required in the diets of

          various animal or microbial species1 but
          there is little or no evidence of their

          dietary essentiality for humans:: (hef. 4).
          While NAS acynowledges that some of

          these classes of substances may 44one day
          be candidates for hLA:sl:: it states that

          there is currently no evidence that these
          substances are essential in humans (hef.

          4).

          As stated in the 44Summary:: section of
          the 1Oth edition of the NAS hLA

          publication (hef. 4)1 the NAS hLA:s are
          based not only on data from nutrient

          intaye measurements but also on
          information from nutrient balance

          studies1 experimental intaye studies1
          biochemical measurements1

          epidemiological observations of nutrient
          status1 and extrapolation of data from

          animal experiments. FLA does not agree
          with the comments that it is desirable to





                                base label reference values for nutrient

                                content claims solely on individual
                                scientifflc research publications1 no matter

                                how current1 or solely on data on
                                amounts of the trace element found in

                                well-balanced diets. The existence of
                                such data does not mean that there is

                                scientifflc agreement on the essentiality of
                                the nutrient or on the recommended level
                                in the diet. Should agreement on the

                                essentiality of additional nutrients be
                                reached1 timely and appropriate changes

                                to the label reference values can be made
                                through FLA:s rulemaying procedures.

                                Nowever1 as stated above1 manufacturers
                                are free to declare the amount of the

                                trace elements1 or choline or inositol1 on

                                13. One comment stated that although

                                no hLl:s have been established for
                                certain vitamins and minerals1 nutrient

                                content claims could be based on
                                reference foods that are recogniked

                                sources of those nutrients. For example1
                                the label could state that 44brand X

                                provides more vitamin K than two
                                servings of cabbagel:: based on the

                                vitamin K content of the reference
                                amount for vegetables without sauce

                                listed in y101.121 Table 2.
                                The agency disagrees. Until a reference

                                standard is established there is no basis
                                for conffldence that cabbage is a good

                                source of vitamin K. There is also no
                                basis for conffldence that the amount of

                                vitamin K in the food that is to be the
                                subdect of the claim is nutritionally

                                signifflcant. Elsewhere in this issue of the
                                Federal hegister 1 the agency has

                                proposed to expand the list of nutrients
                                with hLl:s1 including vitamin K. At this
                                time1 however1 FLA concludes that it

                                would be premature to authorike such
                                claims.

          a. 44Oood source:: and 44high::
          14. One comment encouraged the agency

          to maintain the proposed defflnitions for
          44good source:: and 44high:: for dietary

          supplements. The comment argued that
          a higher level (e.g.1 40 percent of the

          hLl) would suggest to consumers that
          daily nutrient intayes could be achieved

          by consuming only a few foods1 which is
          inconsistent with dietary guidelines. The

          comment maintained that if a new higher
          claim level was adopted for supplements1
          .
          lt would liyely also apply to foods in
          conventional food form based on the

          logic of the proposal for nutrient content
          claims for dietary supplements (i.e.1
                        .
          consistency ln defflnitions). The comment
          stated that users of dietary supplements

          are well aware of the elevated nutrient
          levels in these products1 and that a new

          paradigm is not needed to inform
          consumers of these levels.

          On the other hand1 several comments did
          not support the proposal to use the same

          defflnitions for 44good source:: and 44high::
          claims as those used for foods in

          conventional food form. The comments
          argued that the terms 44good source:: and

          44high:: should not carry the same
          meaning for supplements as for foods in

          conventional food form1 that most
          supplements contain at least 100 percent

          of the Laily Value for most of the
          nutrients they provide1 and that

          consumers expect most of these products
          to contain at least 100 percent of the

          Laily Value. The comments maintained.
          that allowlng any product with as little

          as 10 or 20 percent of the hLl to carry
          44good source:: and 44high:: claims would

          confuse and mislead consumers.
          One comment questioned whether it is

          appropriate to permit the use of these
          nutrient content claims on vitamins and

          mineral supplements since it implies that
          supplements are comparable to1 and

          acceptable substitutes for1 foods in
          conventional food form. The comment

          also noted that nutrition educators feel
          strongly that supplements can enhance

          the nutrient intaye from foods in
          conventional food form but can never

          replace them since foods in conventional





                               food form provides other important
                               components. On the other hand1 many

                               comments supported the proposal to
                               extend the same defflnitions for 44good

                               source:: and 44high:: for foods in
                               conventional food form to dietary

                               supplements. These comments
                               emphasiked the importance of
                                              .
                               consistency ln defflnitions to assist
                               consumer education.

                               One comment requested clarifflcation on
                               whether the terms 44good source:: and

                                44contains:: will be permitted for dietary
                               supplements. The comment maintained

                               that such claims provide consumers with
                               important information regarding the
                               precise content of various nutrients and

                               should not be subdect to discriminatory
                               treatment solely on the basis of whether

                               such claims are made for a nutrient in a
                               dietary supplement as opposed to one in

                               a conventional food.
                               The agency has reviewed these comments

                               and is not persuaded that the defflnition
                               of the terms 44good source:: and 44high::

                               should be different for dietary
                               supplements than for foods in

                               conventional food form. The agency fflnds
                               that the defflnitions for foods in

                               conventional food form and dietary
                               supplements should be consistent. As

                               directed by the 1990 amendments
                                (section 3(b)(l)(A)(iii)(Vl))1 FLA
                               defflned the term 44highl:: and the

                               content claims1 the agency stated that
                               the term 44good source:: may be used to

                               describe a food when a serving of the
                               food contains 10 to 19 percent of the

                               hLl or the LhV for a nutrient. Liyewise1
                               the agency stated that the term 44high::
                               may be used to describe a food when a

                               serving contains 20 percent or more of
                               the hLl or the LhV. FLA concluded

                               that the use of these terms would permit
                               a suMcient number of food items to bear

                                44good source:: and 44high:: claims to allow
                               consumers to use the claims in selecting

                               foods that are better sources of nutrients
                                (3W Fh 2344).

                               While FLA recognikes that under the





          present defflnitions1 most1 if not all1

          dietary supplements of vitamins1
          minerals1 potassium1 and fflber would

          qualify for 44good source:: or 44high::
          claims1 the agency does not agree with

          those comments that argued that the
          defflnitions1 as proposed1 would be

          confusing or misleading to consumers. As
          suggested by the lOM report on

          nutrition labeling (hef. 0)1 the use of
          consistent and targeted content claims

          increases consumers: conffldence in the
          validity of the claim. FLA is aware of no

          evidence to support an alternate
          conclusion. The basic principle of

          consistency in defflnitions of nutrient
          content claims is discussed in detail in

          comment 2 of this document.
          Furthermore1 the agency recognikes that

          consumers expect dietary supplements to
          be concentrated sources of nutrients.

          Consumer studies support this conclusion
          (hefs. 1 and 3). FLA acynowledges that

          the terms 44good source:: and 44high::
          might be of limited utility in comparing

          nutrient content among dietary
          supplements of vitamins and minerals

          because virtually the entire class of
          products would qualify for such claims.

          Nowever1 these terms may be useful for.
          some slngle source dietary supplements

          of calcium1 biotin1 or fflber or for
          multinutrient preparations containing

          these nutrients. These nutrients are
          generally found in dietary supplements at
          levels below the Lally Value..

          Additionally1 FLA believes that these

          terms would be useful in highlighting the
          nutrient content of some herbs and other

          similar nutritional substances that have
          nutrients at levels high enough to qualify

          for the defflnition of one of the above      .
          terms. For these reasons1 the agency ls

          not persuaded to preclude the use of
          these terms for dietary supplements.

          The agency agrees with the comment
          that stated that dietary supplements

          cannot replace foods in conventional food
          form in all respects because the latter

          foods supply other important
          components. Nowever1 FLA recognikes

          that dietary supplements can be a useful
          part of the diet for those who wish to

          maye sure that they consume at least the





                               hLl amount for all vitamins and

                               minerals or for those who wish to
                               increase their daily intaye of a particular

                               substance above those levels that are
                               ordinarily available from conventional
                               foods. Thus1 FLA fflnds that use of these

                               terms on dietary supplements is
                               appropriate.
                                                                         .
                               FLA is convinced that consistency ln

                               defflnitions of nutrient content claims
                               across the food supply is necessary.
                               Consistency facilitates consumer

                               education by limiting the number of
                               terms that the public must learn and

                               interpret. Moreover1 different defflnitions
                               for the same terms for dietary

                               supplements and foods in conventional
                               food form would be confusing to

                               consumers because of the diMculties
                               inherent in learning alternate defflnitions

                               for the same term. There is a greater
                               chance of error and misinterpretation

                               when several defflnitions must be learned
                               for the same term. Thus1 different

                               defflnitions would liyely do more harm
                               than good. Accordingly1 the agency

                               concludes that the proposed defflnitions
                               for 44good source:: and 44high:: are

                               appropriate1 and that there is no reason
                               to defflne the terms differently for dietary
                               supplements.

                               The agency would liye to clarify that
                                44good source:: and 44contains:: as defflned

                                y101.34(c)(l) are nutrient content claims

                               that can be used for foods in
                               conventional food form as well as for
                               dietary supplements. There is nothing in

                               this fflnal rule that states that the use of
                               these terms would not be allowed for

                               dietary supplements.

                                13. One comment stated that under
                               FLA:s proposal1 consumers who want
                               truly high levels that is1 levels that

                               exceed the hLl would have no means of
                               identifying those products1 other than

                               reading the fflne print on the bacy of each
                               supplement label.

                               The comment acynowledged that
                               consumers might also be confused if

                                44high:: had one meaning when the claim
                               appears on labels of dietary supplements

                               and a different meaning when the claim
                               appears on labels of foods in conventional

                               food form. To avoid that inconsistency1





          the comment urged FLA to prohibit the

          claims 44good source:: and 44high:: on
          supplements. Further1 the comment

          suggested that the agency should defflne
          the term 44high potency:: and allow it to

          be used only on supplements.
          FLA disagrees that the terms 44good

          source:: and 44high:: should be prohibited
          on the labels of dietary supplements.

          The agency recognikes that a claim of
           44high:: will not specifflcally identify those

          products that have levels of nutrients
          that exceed the hLl. Nowever1 the

          quantitative amount of a nutrient in a
          dietary supplement is often a part of the

          statement of identity for the product1
          and additional quantitative information

          regarding the level of a nutrient may also
          be found in amount or percentage

          statements on the principal display
          panel. ln addition1 as a result of the

          agency:s new format requirements1 the
          nutrition label for dietary supplements of

          vitamins and minerals provides
          quantitative information on the levels of

          specifflc nutrients as well as the percent
          LV for each nutrient in a more legible

          format. Consequently1 consumers will
          have easy access to information regarding

          the levels of specifflc nutrients and may
          addust their levels of intaye accordingly.

          Further1 as discussed in the previous
          comment1 while the terms 44good source::

          and 44high:: may be of limited utility for
          dietary supplements of vitamins and

          minerals1 these terms may be useful in
          highlighting the nutritional content of
            .
          slngle nutrients1 such as biotin and
          calcium1 that are generally found in

          products at levels well below the hLl1 as
          well as of dietary supplements of herbs

          and other similar nutritional products.
          Therefore1 FLA concludes that

          precluding the use of these terms on
          dietary supplements is undustiffled.

          Nowever1 FLA believes that there is a
          suMcient basis to consider defflning the

          term 44high potency:: or some similar
          term as a nutrient content claim. FLA:s

          tentative view is that this term1 or a
          similar term when defflned1 could provide

          a way for manufacturers to describe the
          higher levels of nutrients in dietary

          supplements. (See comment 23 for





                               further discussion of this matter.)

                               b. 44More::

                                1O. One comment stated that consumers
                               could be misled if comparative claims are

                               made among high potency
                               vitamin)mineral supplements. The

                               comment stated that if1 for example1 one
                               brand of 300-mg vitamin b0 tablets
                               claimed that it contained 44more:: than a

                               competitive 230-mg product1 then the

                               consumer may get the misleading
                               impression that the former product is

                               better. The comment maintained that as
                               customers shop for supplements1 they
                               will be able to readily observe whether

                               one product is more potent than another
                               without label claims suggesting

                               superiority of one over another. lf such a
                               claim resulted in better sales1 then a

                                44horsepower race:: would ensue. The
                               comment recommended that 44more::

                               claims for vitamins and minerals not be
                                allowed if the nutrient potency of the

                               reference product already meets or
                               exceeds 100 percent of the Lally Value..

                               The agency acynowledges that there is

                               the possibility that some manufacturers
                               may choose to increase potencies in order

                               to maye a 44more:: claim in comparison to
                                another brand1 but the agency disagrees

                               that the limitation suggested by the
                               comment is warranted at this time. The
                                agency points out that 44more:: claims for

                               nutrients with an hLl or LhV1 including

                               those products with nutrients in
                               megadoses1 such as those in the example
                               cited by the comment1 must include the
                                      .
                               followlng information: The percentage
                                (or fraction) that the nutrient was

                               increased relative to the hLl or LhV1
                               the identity of the reference food1 and

                               the quantitative amount of the nutrient
                               present (e.g.1 contains 4420 percent more

                               of the LV for vitamin b0 per tablet than
                               product 4x:. The vitamin b0 content of

                               product 4x: is 230 mg. This product
                               contains 300 mg vitamin bO.::) The

                               nutrition label of a product containing
                                300 mg of vitamin b0 must state that

                               the product contains 11300 percent of the
                               Laily Value. The agency acynowledges

                               that the amount of information required
                               to maye a 44more:: claim is considerable1

                               but such information is necessary to





          allow consumers to readily see how the

          amount of a nutrient for which a 44more::
          claim is made fflts into the total daily

          diet. Furthermore1 FLA believes that the
          concern regarding 44horsepower races:: in

          dietary supplements stems from concerns
          of possible unfair maryeting among

          manufacturers as well as from safety
          concerns inherent in the addition of very

          high levels of nutrients to supplements.
          Similar concerns with foods in

          conventional food form led to the
          establishment of FLA:s fortifflcation
          policy ln 19WO. This policy1 while.

          published in y104.201 does not have the
          force of a regulation. Nowever1 the

          agency has not found evidence of
          widespread 44horsepower races:: with such

          foods. The agency urges industry1
          particularly industry associations1 to

          develop standards regarding nutrient
          levels and to monitor compliance with

          those standards to minimike any safety
          problems.

          c. hestrictions on label or labeling claims

          based on section 411(b)(2)(b) of the act
           1l. One comment from a trade

          association stated that the literal reading
          of section 411(b)(2)(b) of the act

          prohibits giving prominence on the label
          of dietary supplements of vitamins or

          minerals to ingredients that are not
          vitamins or minerals. The comment

          argued that these prohibitions result in
          the withholding of information that is of

          interest to consumers1 and that it is
          increasingly common for manufacturers
          to maryet products that offer a

          combination of vitamins1 minerals1 herbs1
          and other dietary substances. The

          comment stated that the principal reason
          for the purchase of these products is not

          their vitamin and mineral content but
          the other ingredients. The comment

          invited FLA to doin the supplement
          industry ln seeying an amendment to.

          section 411 of the act that will remedy
          this problem.

          Another comment disagreed with FLA:s

          interpretation of section 411(b)(2)(b) of
          the act and suggested that this section
          merely prohibits giving prominence or

          emphasis to such ingredients. The
          comment argued that nutrients other





                                than vitamins and minerals or sources of

                                vitamins and minerals should be
                                permitted to appear outside or
                                                       .
                                immediately followlng the nutrition label1
                                providing that such information is not

                                emphasiked by1 for example1 being
                                presented in type sike greater than that

                                used in the nutrition label. The comment
                                stated that such limited declarations

                                would not confflict with current
                                provisions of the act and would be fair

                                and reasonable means of communicating
                                about the presence of ingredients that

                                provide added value to many dietary
                                supplement products.
                                               .
                                The agency ls persuaded by these
                                comments that a clarifflcation of those

                                sections of the proposal relating to
                                section 411(b)(2)(b) of the act is needed.

                                Section 411(b)(2)(b) of the act states
                                that the labeling and advertising for

                                dietary supplements of vitamins and
                                minerals may not give prominence to or

                                emphasike ingredients that are not
                                vitamins1 minerals1 or represented as a

                                source of vitamins or minerals. because
                                of this provision1 nutrient content claims

                                about ingredients that are not vitamins
                                or minerals (e.g.1    44more fflberl:: 44high
                                protein:: ) may not be made on dietary

                                supplements of vitamins or minerals.

                                lt must be emphasiked that this
                                provision pertains only to dietary

                                supplements of vitamins and minerals. lf1
                                for example1 an herbal extract includes

                                vitamins and minerals but is labeled as
                                an herbal extract1 in compliance with

                                 y101.9 and other applicable provisions1

                                411(b)(2)(b) of the act would not apply.
                                The same is true for a product that is

                                primarily a protein supplement. A
                                protein supplement with added vitamins
                                and minerals that is labeled and

                                advertised as a protein supplement could
                                declare that it is high in fflber. Such

                                claims are permissible as long as they are
                                made in accordance with section 403(r)

                                of the act1 and they are not false or
                                misleading ln any particular..

                                Nowever1 section 411(b)(2)(b) of the act

                                mayes clear that in the labeling and
                                advertising of dietary supplements of

                                vitamins and minerals1 ingredients other





          than vitamins or minerals cannot be

          emphasiked or given prominence. FLA
          interprets prominence not solely as a

          function of type sike. Leclaring an
          lngredient outside or immediately.
                  .
          followlng the nutrition label is another
          means of giving prominence. For

          example1 a statement such as 443 g
          psylliuml:: except in extremely limited

          circumstances1 cannot be made on the
          principal display panel1 outside the
                                                        .
          nutrition label1 or immediately followlng

          the nutrition label of a dietary
          supplement of vitamins and minerals

          because such placements give prominence
          to that ingredient. Nowever1 the

          declaration of psyllium in the ingredient
          list would not be construed as giving

          prominence to that ingredient. On the
          other hand1 443 g psyllium:: could be

          declared in an amount statement on the
          principal display panel1 outside1 or
                                 .
          immediately followlng the nutrition label
          on protein supplements1 on dietary

          supplements of herbal extracts1 and on
          dietary supplements of other similar

          nutritional substances so long as these
          dietary supplements are not subdect to

          section 411 of the act.
          FLA advises that if a sugar is an
           .
          lngredient in a dietary supplement of
          vitamins or minerals1 claims about the

           amount of sugar actually in the product
          would have to be restricted. Nowever1

           44sugar-free:: and 44no added sugar:: are
           absence claims that assert that sugar is

          not an ingredient. The agency concludes
          that the use of these terms is acceptable

          on dietary supplements of vitamins or
          minerals1 as well as on other types of

          dietary supplements.

          ln view of this clarifflcation1 the agency
          believes that section 411(b)(2)(b) of the
                              .
           act1 as written1 ls suMciently fflexible to
           accommodate claims on products that

           are not dietary supplements of vitamins
          or minerals. FLA believes that it is

          therefore unnecessary to amend section
          411 of the act.

           2. Nutrient Content Claims for Sugar
           Content

           1W. One comment questioned the
           appropriateness of allowlng 44sugar-free::.

          claims for a dietary supplement





                                containing less than 0.3 g of sugars. The

                                comment stated that many supplements
                                come in capsules or tablets that weigh

                                slightly less or not much more than 0.3 g1
                                and therefore1 supplements that are

                                mostly sugars could use the term
                                44sugar-free.:: The comment suggested

                                that the term 44sugar free:: on a dietary
                                supplement should mean a much lower

                                amount of sugars1 or that the product
                                should be totally devoid of sugars.

                                The comment also argued that terms
                                such as 44negligible source of sugarl::

                                44dietarily insignifflcant source of sugarl::
                                and 44trivial source of sugar:: are not

                                synonymous with 44sugar-free:: because
                                such terms connote the presence of some

                                sugar content.

                                FLA is not persuaded by the comment            .
                                that 0.3 g or less of sugars per serving ls
                                an inappropriate defflnition of

                                insignifflcance for sugars for dietary

                                supplements. Section 101.00(c)(l)
                                provides that for a food in conventional
                                food form to maye a 44sugar free:: claim1

                                the food must contain less than 0.3 g of
                                sugars per reference amount. Less than

                                0.3 g of sugars per reference amount is an
                                amount that is consistent with the

                                agency:s policy of defflning 44free:: claims
                                at or near the reliable limit of detection

                                and in an amount that is dietetically
                                inconsequential (30 Fh 00421 at 00432).

                                As a result1 even frequent consumption of
                                a food bearing a 44sugar free:: claim

                                would not result in an intaye of sugars
                                that would affect the overall diet in any

                                meaningful way.

                                FLA acynowledges that there may be
                                situations in which a dietary supplement

                                may contain a signifflcant proportion of
                                sugars on a weight basis and be able to

                                maye the claim 44sugar free.:: The agency
                                believes1 however1 that even in such

                                instances1 if the total amount of sugars in
                                a serving of the product is less than 0.3

                                g1 its net contribution to the total daily
                                diet would be inconsequential.

                                Additionally1 FLA considers it important
                                that nutrient content claims correspond

                                with the nutrition label1 which serves as
                                a source of specifflc information for

                                consumers concerning the nutritional
                                value of the food. The nutrition labeling





          regulations allow foods containing less
          than 0.3 g sugars per labeled serving to

          declare 0 g of sugars (yy101.9(c)(O)(ii)
           and 101.30(b)(3)).

          FLA redects the suggestion that it permit
          use of the term 44sugar free:: only where

          there is an absolute absence of sugars.
          FLA believes that it is appropriate to

           apply the term 44free:: to a nutrient when
           a food contains that nutrient in a

          dietetically trivial or physiologically
          inconsequential amount1 even though the

          nutrient is present at a level at or near
          its reliable limit of quantitation1 because

          with modern analytical methods1 the
          level at which the presence of a nutrient
          may be quantiffled is becoming

          increasingly smaller (3W Fh 2302 at
           2320). The agency believes that it is

           appropriate to focus on dietary
          insignifflcance1 and very trivial amounts

          have no impact on the diet for the
          purpose of defflning 44sugar free.::

          The agency also disagrees that the terms
           44negligible source of sugarl:: 44dietarily

          insignifflcant source of sugar:: 1 and 44trivial
          source of sugar:: are inappropriate

          synonyms for 44sugar free.:: Section
          403(r)(2)(A)(i) of the act states that a

          nutrient content claim must be defflned
          by regulation. ln addition1 section

           (3)(b)(l)(A)(ix) of the 1990 amendments
          provides that those regulations may
          include similar terms commonly

          understood to have the same meaning.
          The agency ls not aware of any reason.

          why the above terms are inappropriate
          synonyms for 44sugar free.:: Although

          these synonyms do not convey the
           absolute absence of sugar1 they refflect

          that the amounts are dietetically trivial
           and of no dietary signifflcance. Therefore1

          the agency redects this comment.
           19. One comment stated that the term

           44no added sugar:: can be used only when
           a product is expected to contain sugar1

          but that consumers do not ynow when
          supplements are expected to contain

          sugars. The comments suggested that
          FLA should not preclude the use of the
          term 44no added sugars:: as this term

          would be useful to consumers in
          identifying those products without sugar.
                         .
          The agency ls persuaded that a review of





                                the conditions for the use of the term 44no
                                added sugar:: is warranted. FLA did not

                                propose to preclude the use of the term
                                44no added sugar:: on all dietary

                                supplements. The agency fflnds that this
                                term is appropriate for some dietary

                                supplements1 such as children:s chewable
                                vitamins1 that are frequently sweetened.

                                Section 101.00(c)(2) states that the
                                terms 44no added sugarl:: 44without added
                                sugarl:: or 44no sugar added:: may be used

                                only if: (l) No amount of sugars1 as

                                defflned in y101.9(c)(O)(ii)1 or any.

                                functionally substitutes for added sugars
                                .

                                the ingredients by some means such as

                                the use of enkymes1 (4) the food that it
                                resembles and for which it substitutes

                                (3) the product bears a statement that
                                the food is not 44low calorie:: or 44calorie

                                requirements for a 44low:: or 44reduced

                                calorie:: food) and that directs
                                consumers: attention to the nutrition

                                label for further information on sugar
                                and calorie content.

                                As is the case for foods in conventional

                                food form1 the agency believes that to
                                avoid misleading consumers1 the term
                                44no added sugar:: should be limited to

                                dietary supplements that would be
                                expected to contain added sugars. The

                                agency advises that the purpose of a 44no
                                added sugar:: claim is to identify a food

                                that differs from a similar food because it
                                does not contain the added sugars that

                                would normally be present in the similar
                                food. For this provision to be of practical

                                benefflt to consumers1 it must preclude
                                the use of the claim on a food where the

                                sugars that are normally added are
                                replaced with an ingredient that contains
                                sugars that functionally substitute for

                                the added sugars. Thus1 the agency
                                concludes that the use of any lngredient.

                                that contains sugars that would normally
                                be added to a food precludes the use of

                                the 44no added sugar:: nutrient content





          claim. The agency believes that claims

          concerning the absence of added sugars
          on products that would not normally

          contain added sugar (e.g.1 dietary
          supplements of vitamins and minerals for
          adults) are liyely to mislead consumers

          into thinying that a particular brand
          may be more desirable when compared to

          other brands of the same product.
          FLA acynowledges that consumers may

          not ynow every type of product that
          could be expected to contain sugar.

          Nowever1 the fflnal rule on nutrition
          labeling for dietary supplements

          published elsewhere in this issue of the
          Federal hegister speciffles that sugars will

          be listed in the ingredient label and must
          be declared in the nutrition label if

          present in more than insignifflcant
          amounts. Through these provisions the

          consumer can readily ascertain which
          products contain sugars.

          C. lmplied Nutrient Content Claims
           1. Claims That are not Nutrient Content

          Claims
          Section 101.03(b)(l) of the fflnal rule on

          nutrient content claims provides that
          statements that declare the absence of

          food components or ingredients that are
          not nutrients of the type required to be

          declared on the nutrition label1 and that
          are intended to facilitate avoidance for

          such reasons as food intolerance (e.g.1

          concluded that this paragraph is
          applicable to dietary supplements and
          requested comment on other examples

          that are appropriate for dietary

          synthetic ingredients. The comments
          requested that FLA confflrm that these

          statements are allowed on the label.





                                None of the terms that were submitted in
                                the comments other than 44egg free::

                                would constitute nutrient content claims.
                                The term 44egg free:: can be interpreted

                                as an implied claim about cholesterol.

                                The agency points out that it does not
                                currently have a defflnition for 44artifflcial::

                                except as that term applies to fflavors and
                                colors. Similarly1 it has no defflnition for
                                 44synthetic:: except as that term applies

                                to fflavors and colors. Although these
                                terms have not been defflned by FLA1 the

                                agency believes that they are not nutrient
                                content claims unless they are used in a

                                context in which they explicitly or
                                implicitly describe the level of a nutrient.

                                Nowever1 even if these terms are not
                                nutrient content claims1 manufacturers

                                who use them must maye sure that their
                                use is not false or misleading.

                                2l. FLA proposed to include dietary
                                supplements in the coverage of

                                 y101.03(b)(4). This section states that
                                when an ingredient constitutes essentially

                                 100 percent of a food1 so that the name
                                of the ingredient is the statement of

                                identity1 the name of the ingredient
                                generally does not constitute an implied

                                nutrient content claim unless it is used in
                                a context to suggest that a nutrient is

                                absent or present in a certain amount.
                                FLA used a statement of identity for a

                                dietary supplement in which an.
                                lngredient constitutes essentially 100
                                percent of a supplement (e.g. 4400

                                mg     vitamin C::) as an example. One
                                comment pointed out that 00 mg vitamin

                                C tablets contain excipients (fflllers1
                                binders1 lubricants1 disintegrants) other

                                than vitamin C. The comment requested
                                clarifflcation as to whether1 in the

                                example of vitamin C tablets1
                                 y101.03(b)(4) requires that the amount

                                claimed in the statement of identity
                                constitute 100 percent of the claimed

                                amount of a food in y101.03(b)(4).
                                ln the example added to y101.03(b)(4)1

                                the amount refers to the claimed
                                nutrient. A tablet stating 4400

                                mg     vitamin C tablets:: should contain
                                00 mg of that nutrient. The agency

                                recognikes that a nutrient will not
                                constitute precisely 100 percent of some

                                dietary supplements1 such as vitamin





           tablets or capsules1 and advises that

           small amounts of excipients1 binders1
           lubricants1 or disintegrants added for

           technological purposes are allowable in
           addition to the stated nutrient content.

           Additionally1 FLA points out that under
           y101.3(c)1 if a food is maryeted in various

           optional forms1 the particular form is a
           necessary part of the statement of

           identity. because vitamin C is maryeted
           in tablet1 capsule1 and liquid form1 the

           form is part of the name. Therefore1 this
           food should be called 4400 mg-vitamin C

           tablets.:: The agency acynowledges an
           error in this regard in the proposal and is

           revising y101.03(b)(4) to maye the
           correction.

           22. One comment stated that it is not

           unusual for a dietary supplement to
           contain several nutrients of one type and
           a slngle nutrient of another type1 such as.

           44multiple-vitamins with iron.:: The
           comment requested confflrmation that

           44with iron:: would not represent an
           implied nutrient content claim.

           The agency advises that a term such as

           44with ironl:: when used on the statement
           of identity of a supplement1 is intended

           to describe the nature of the food. When
           a statement of identity simply states

           44with iron:: or speciffles the amount of
           iron in a product (e.g.1     44multivitamin

           with 13 mg iron::)1 the statement is not a
           nutrient content claim. Such statements

           fall under y101.03(b)(3).
           Nowever1 as the agency stated in

           y101.03(b)(3)1 there may be cases in
           which other statements on the label or

           labeling would have the effect of maying
           the statement into a nutrient content

           claim. For example1 if the labeling of a
           multivitamin with iron includes a

           discussion of the importance of iron in
           the diet1 FLA believes the statement

           44with iron:: would be an implied claim
           that the multivitamin is a good source of

           iron. lf the labeling is devoid of such
           information1 FLA would be unliyely to

           consider the name to be an implied
           nutrient content claim. The agency will

           evaluate such claims on a case-by-case
           basis in the context of the entire label

           and labeling to determine whether they
           are nutrient content claims.





                                 23. One comment maintained that FLA

                                 failed to address whether the currently
                                 used claim of 44high in antioxidants:: was

                                 within the scope of the proposed
                                 regulation.

                                 While the term 44high in antioxidants::
                                 was not explicitly discussed in the

                                 proposed regulations for nutrient content
                                 claims for dietary supplements1 the

                                 agency considers it to be an implied
                                 nutrient content claim that would come

                                 under y101.03. FLA:s view is that this
                                 claim implies that the food on which it

                                 appears contains a 44high:: amount (i.e.1
                                 at least 20 percent of the hLl1 see

                                 y101.34(b)(l)) of each antioxidant. One
                                 problem with this claim1 however1 is that

                                 there is no established defflnition of
                                 44antioxidants.::

                                 FLA believes that a logical place to start
                                 in defflning this term is section

                                 3(b)(l)(A)(x) of the 1990 amendments.
                                 That provision directed FLA to

                                 determine whether a health claim on
                                 antioxidant vitamins and cancer1 could

                                 be authoriked under the standard that it
                                 established for dietary supplements

                                 under section 403(r)(3)(L) of the act. ln
                                 its proposed regulations to implement

                                 the 1990 amendments1 in response to this
                                 provision1 FLA considered the effects of

                                 vitamin C1 vitamin E1 and beta -carotene
                                 on cancer because these nutrients are the

                                 vitamins or provitamins that function as
                                 antioxidants (30 Fh 000241 November 211

                                 1991). ln the fflnal rule on antioxidant
                                 vitamins and cancer1 FLA concluded

                                 that its selection of these nutrients was
                                 appropriate (3W Fh 20221 'anuary 01

                                 1993). Thus1 the agency has determined
                                 that the direct-acting antioxidant

                                 vitamins or provitamins include vitamin
                                 C1 vitamin E1 and beta -carotene. based

                                 on its review of the information
                                 presented at a recent conference entitled

                                 44Antioxidant Vitamins and Cancer and
                                 Cardiovascular Liseasel:: which was
                                                                     .
                                 initiated by FLA1 the agency ls not
                                 aware of any basis to expand this list
                                 because the biological role of other

                                 vitamins as direct antioxidants has not

                                 been confflrmed (hef. 3).
                                 While it is arguable that FLA could

                                 authorike 44high in antioxidants:: as an





          implied claim pertaining to antioxidant

          vitamins as a logical outgrowth of the
          proposal1 because the claim applies to

          foods in conventional food form as well
           as to dietary supplements1 the agency

          believes that the better course is to
          propose to authorike such a claim. ln
           addition1 the defflnition of 44antioxidants::
           .
          ls not free from controversy. The agency
          ls aware1 based on its review of dietary.

          supplements whose labeling currently
          includes a 44high in antioxidant:: claim1

          that some manufacturers view this term
           as including certain minerals.

          Antioxidant minerals have not been
           addressed by the agency1 and1 therefore1

          fflnal rules implementing the 1990
           amendments do not provide for claims

           about them. Thus1 FLA fflnds that a
          rulemaying on the defflnition of

           44antioxidants:: will provide an
          opportunity to establish the precise

          meaning of this term.
           Consequently1 FLA intends to address

          this issue as quicyly as possible in a
          forthcoming proposal. Oiven that1

          elsewhere in this issue of the Federal.
          hegister 1 the agency ls establishing a

          date of applicability of 'uly 31 19931 for
          this regulation1 FLA anticipates that

          there is suMcient time to taye fflnal action
          on such a proposal before that date.
           2. 44Nealthier::

           24. One comment from a manufacturer
          observed that FLA proposed a regulation

          concerning use of the term 44healthy::
           (proposed y101.03(d)(2) (3W Fh 2949)) in

          the 'anuary 01 1993 Federal hegister (3W
          Fh 2944 at 2949). The comment notes

          that 44healthy:: and similar terms are used
          ln a variety of contexts. For example1 one.

          of the manufacturer:s dietary
          supplements is labeled as 44the way to





                                 a healthier life.:: The comment suggested
                                 that this claim should not be deemed to

                                 be subdect to the 44healthy:: defflnition.
                                 FLA advises that it is in the process of

                                 fflnaliking regulations on the 'anuary 01
                                 19931 proposal for the claim 44healthy.::

                                 The use of terms such as 44healthyl::
                                 44healthierl:: 44healthiest:: will be

                                 addressed in that fflnal rule.
                                 ln its fflnal rule on nutrient content

                                 claims1 FLA concluded that a claim that
                                 a food1 because of its nutrient content1

                                 may be useful in maintaining healthy
                                 dietary practices is a claim that

                                 characterikes the level of a nutrient in
                                 that food (3W Fh 2302 at 2313).

                                 Accordingly1 the agency provided in
                                 y101.03(d)(l) that such statements are

                                 implied nutrient content claims and are
                                 subdect to the requirements of section
                                 403(r) of the act.

                                 when a term such as 44healthyl::

                                 44wholesomel:: or 44nutritious:: appears on
                                 a food label in a context that does not

                                 (3W Fh 2302 at 2313). Under such

                                 conditions1 the use of the term is subdect
                                 to section 403(a) of the act1 and FLA

                                 will consider whether it is misleading on
                                 a case-by-case basis. The agency intends

                                 to give more specifflc guidance in the fflnal

                                 44balancedl:: which are often encountered

                                 on labels or in labeling of dietary
                                 supplements and which seem to imply

                                 that the dietary supplement will
                                 contribute to good health (3W Fh 33131

                                 at 3314W). The agency requested
                                 comment on whether there are

                                 established meanings for these terms1
                                 and1 if so1 whether they characterike the

                                 level of the nutrients in the food. FLA
                                 stated that if comments demonstrate





          that there are accepted defflnitions used

          in the dietary supplement industry for
          these terms that characterike the level of

          nutrients1 and that if it determines that
          these defflnitions will assist consumers in
          maintaining healthy dietary practices1

          FLA will proceed with further
          rulemaying to adopt the defflnitions or to

          propose new ones.

          FLA also stated that if the agency agrees
          that such terms are nutrient content
          claims1 under the provisions of the

          statute1 such claims would be prohibited
          after the effective date for fflnal rules1

          until such time as they are defflned by
          FLA by regulation. Further1 FLA stated

          that if comments demonstrate that there
          are accepted defflnitions for these terms1

          and they do not characterike the level of
          nutrients1 in accordance with

           y101.03(d)(l) such terms would not be
          subdect to section 403(r) of the act unless

          used in a nutritional context in
          association with an explicit or implicit

          claim or statement characteriking the
          nutrient content of the food.

          23. Several comments maintained that
          the terms 44high potencyl:: 44high

          absorptionl:: and 44balanced:: are implied
          nutrient content claims and urged the

          agency to defflne or prohibit these terms.
          The comments stated that it is

          inappropriate and fraught with
          possibilities for deception to allow each

          manufacturer to defflne such claims. One
          comment stated that although these

          terms imply features of nutrient content
          to consumers1 they do not have any
          established or useful meaning with regard

          to dietary supplements. The comment
          argued that these terms seem to be more

          specifflc to dietary supplements than to
          other food1 so that their applicability in

          helping consumers maye appropriate
          nutritional choices from the variety of

          foods available seems limited.
          On the other hand1 several comments

          stated that these terms do not inherently
          refer to the level of nutrients1 are not

          nutrient content claims1 and therefore
          should not be defflned. These comments

          maintained that such terms are
          formulation descriptions1 which properly

          and truthfully describe the nature and





                               type of the product. These comments

                               contended that these terms have been
                               used for many years1 and that consumers

                               have come to understand that products
                               so described provide an amount of the

                               primary nutrients in the formulation that.
                               ls at least equal to the hLA:s for those

                               nutrients.
                               One comment argued that FLA

                               precedent exists for excluding such terms
                               from regulation as nutrient content

                               claims. The comment stated that as
                               formulation descriptions1 these terms are

                               useful to consumers in helping them to
                               maye product choices1 and manufacturers

                               should be allowed to continue to use
                               these terms in a manner that is

                               consistent with FLA:s policy on claims
                               such as 44maximum strength:: for internal

                               analgesics in the over-the-counter drug
                               review (i.e.1 yept outside the scope of this

                               rulemaying).
                               The agency agrees that these terms seem

                               to have more direct application to
                               dietary supplements than to foods in

                               conventional food form. Furthermore1
                               these terms may have some utility ln     .

                               helping consumers select among dietary
                               supplements. Nowever1 while these terms

                               have apparently been used for years to.
                               imply superiority1 the agency ls uncertain

                               what they mean to consumers.
                               The agency disagrees that these terms

                               should be regulated in the same manner
                               as terms such as 44maximum strengthl::

                               which are used on the labels of
                               over-the-counter drug products. The

                               over-the-counter drug regulations include
                               maximum amount limitations. Section

                               411(a)(l)(A) of the act prohibits limits
                               on the potency of dietary supplements of

                               vitamins or minerals except on the basis
                               of safety. Therefore1 the situations are

                               not analogous.
                               The agency believes that each of these

                               terms should be evaluated individually
                               because they do not seem to be

                               synonymous. 44Nigh potency:: seems to
                               focus on nutrient level or content1 but

                               44balancedl:: as one comment suggested1
                               seems to be a formulation claim.        44Nigh

                               absorption:: seems to focus on how the
                               body responds to the nutrient. The

                               agency will address each of these terms in





          more detail in the comments that follow.

          b. Lefflnition for 44high potency::
          2O. The madority of comments stated

          that the term 44high potency:: or 44full
          potency:: is an implied nutrient content

          claim and should be defflned. Several
          defflnitions were offered for this term. A

          few comments stated that multivitamins
          and minerals are termed 44high potency::
          when the madority of nutrients with

          established hLA:s are present at the
          levels equal to or in excess of the hLA.

          Similarly1 another comment stated that
          the term should be restricted to

          formulations that contain micronutrients
          at levels of at least twice the applicable

          hLl or LhV because a multivitamin at
          100 percent of the LV might be 44high

          potency:: compared to a food in
          conventional food form but not 44high

          potency:: when compared to other
          dietary supplements.

          Another comment suggested that FLA
          should require a 44high potency::
           .
          slngle-ingredient supplement to contain
          at least twice the hLl1 and that the front

          of the label should disclose what multiple
          of the hLl the supplement contains. The

          comment acynowledged that under this
          scheme1 some nutrients1 such as calcium

          and selenium1 would not qualify to carry
          a 44high potency:: claim1 because they are
          rarely sold at double the hLl. The

          comment suggested that if the
          supplement industry begins to maryet

          those supplements at higher doses in
          order to maye 44high potency:: claims1

          then FLA could establish a lower
          minimum level1 such as 30 percent more

          than the hLl for selenium or 30 percent
          of the hLl for calcium. Those minimum

          levels would apply to those nutrients
          only. The comment also suggested that

          FLA should allow 44high potency:: claims
          on multinutrient supplements when more

          than one-third of the nutrients that they
          contain meet the minimum level required
          for a high potency claim1 and the label

          discloses which nutrients are present at
          high levels. For example1 the label of a

          44high potency:: multivitamin could carry
          an asterisy next to the claim1 with the
                 .
          followlng disclosure: 44contains high levels
          of Snumber] vitamins.::





                                Further1 the comment stated that it is

                                not reasonable to require that all of the
                                nutrients in a multinutrient supplement

                                be present at levels that are necessary for
                                high potency claims because many

                                nutrients are not      and should not be
                                sold in such high doses. For example1 the

                                comment suggested that 44high potency::
                                claims should be allowed on a

                                multivitamin-and-mineral supplement
                                that contains at least double the hLl of

                                vitamins A1 C1 E1 b01 b121 thiamin1
                                ribofflavin1 and niacin but smaller

                                amounts of vitamin L1 iron1 calcium1
                                magnesium1 kinc1 and copper. The

                                comment stated that the latter nutrients
                                are typically sold at doses lower than

                                double the hLl and may pose a risy at
                                high levels.

                                FLA has reviewed the comments and is
                                persuaded that 44high potency:: is a claim

                                that characterikes the level of a nutrient
                                and therefore meets the defflnition in

                                y101.13(b) of a nutrient content claim.
                                FLA also is persuaded by the comments

                                that this is a term that FLA should
                                defflne in order to ensure that it will be

                                useful to consumers in maintaining
                                healthy dietary practices. Nowever1 given

                                the range and diversity of the suggested.
                                defflnitions1 the agency ls not prepared to

                                offer a defflnition of 44high potency:: at
                                this time. FLA intends to review the

                                suggestions it received on this issue and
                                based on information received in

                                comments1 issue a proposed rule on an
                                appropriate defflnition of 44high potency.::

                                FLA recognikes that there is a need to
                                provide this defflnition as quicyly as

                                possible. Therefore1 FLA intends to act
                                on this matter as expeditiously as its

                                resources allow.
                                c. Lefflnitions for 44high absorption::

                                2l. A couple of comments stated that
                                the term 44high absorption:: does not

                                refer to the level of nutrients but rather
                                to bioavailability or how eMciently the

                                nutrients are released from the product
                                and absorbed into the bloodstream. One

                                comment stated that 44high absorption::
                                means that the product meets the

                                defflnition for 44highl:: and that a 44high
                                amount:: is digested and assimilated.

                                Another comment stated that from a





          biological viewpoint1 the extent to which
          nutrients are absorbed from food or

          supplements depends not only on the
          chemical form of the nutrient itself but

          on the chemical environment presented
          by the carrier food in which it is

          contained and on the physiological state
          of nutrient need of the individual

          consumer. Oiven these factors1 the
          comment stated that it is diMcult to

          provide a meaningful defflnition of
          absorbability.

          One comment requested that the label
          should disclose information about the

          bioavailability of the product. Another
          comment suggested that FLA should

          allow labels to maye 44high absorption::
          or similar claims only when the

          manufacturer supplies bioavailability.
          data showlng that the product is better
          absorbed than a standard supplement.

          The comment stated that the agency
          should not allow this claim on

          supplements that simply meet or exceed
          the United States pharmacopeial

          Convention:s (USp:s) (or other)
          standards for disintegration or

          dissolution1 because meeting those
          standards does not ensure that the

          product is well absorbed.
          The agency agrees that the term 44high

          absorption:: generally refers to how well a
          nutrient is absorbed into the system. A

          product can be well absorbed irrespective
          of the quantitative amount found in the

          product. Accordingly1 FLA fflnds that
           44high absorption:: is not a nutrient

          content claim and thus will not defflne
          this term. The use of this term is subdect

          to section 201(n) and 403(a) of the act1
          however. The agency expects that any
          product bearing a 44high absorption::

          claim will contain the nutrients that are
          the subdect of the claim in a form than

          can be readily assimilated by the body.
          ln addition1 manufacturers who maye a

           44high absorption:: claim should have
          data available to support the claim and

          should be prepared to maye such data
          available to regulatory oMcials on

          request. Failure to do so could lead the
          agency to conclude that there is no basis

          for the claim1 and thus that it is false or
          misleading.





                                d. Lefflnitions for 44balanced::

                                2W. A few comments stated that
                                44balanced:: is not a nutrient content

                                claim. One comment suggested that
                                44balanced:: refers to the ratio of

                                nutrients1 not the level1 and that the
                                term can apply equally to products

                                containing low or high quantities of
                                nutrients. Another comment stated that
                                there is little need for FLA to defflne

                                44balanced:: because most multinutrient
                                supplements that are currently on the

                                maryet do not contain nutrients in
                                proportions that would impair the

                                absorption or utilikation of other
                                nutrients. The comment suggested that
                                                       .
                                until researchers galn further information
                                on the most favorable proportions of

                                nutrients in supplements1 the agency
                                should leave this term undefflned and

                                therefore prohibited. Another comment
                                suggested that 44balanced:: be defflned as

                                any supplement containing from 30 to
                                130 percent of the hLl for each vitamin

                                and mineral component of the product
                                for which an hLl has been established.
                                              .
                                The agency ls persuaded by the
                                comments that the term 44balanced:: does

                                not typically characterike the level of
                                nutrients1 but rather that it is a

                                formulation claim that addresses the
                                ratio of nutrients. The term 44balanced::

                                may be used in different ways1 each of
                                which relates to the formulation of a
                                product. For example1 the term

                                44balanced:: may refer to the assortment
                                of nutrients that are present in a

                                product1 or it may refflect interactions
                                between the nutrients present1 such as

                                sparing effects or impairment or
                                enhancement of absorption. Accordingly1

                                this term does not meet the defflnition for
                                a nutrient content claim in y101.13(b).

                                Therefore1 the use of the term
                                44balanced:: is subdect to sections 403(a)

                                and 201(n) of the act and not section
                                403(r) of the act. The agency will

                                determine whether the use of this term is
                                misleading on a case-by-case basis.

                                e. Temporary suspension of the use of
                                terms

                                29. One comment stated that use of the
                                terms 44high potencyl:: 44high absorptionl::

                                and 44balanced:: should not be suspended





          temporarily during the rulemaying

          process because such a suspension would
          result in unnecessary labeling costs.

          Another comment requested additional
          time to comment on the defflnition of
          44high potency:: and suggested that until

          FLA defflnes this term1 the agency should
          permit dietary supplement manufacturers

          to continue to use this term as it is
          currently being used. The comment

          suggested that as an executive agency1
          FLA has inherent authority to refrain

          from enforcing a statutory provision in
          circumstances in which the enforcement

          would do more harm than good. The
          comment argued that to the extent that

          44high potency:: is being used as part of a
          brand name (and was being used before

          October 231 19W9)1 the 1990 amendments
          permit its continued use in the brand

          name until FLA has defflned the term
          (section 403(r)(2)(C) of the act).

          The comment argued that there is no
          reason for FLA to prohibit the use of a

          nutrient content claim while a defflnition
          is being developed. Further1 the

          comment noted that an enforcement
          moratorium would avoid the relabeling

          problem that would arise if FLA
          disapproves and then reapproves use of

          the term within a short period of time.
          The comment stated that FLA will

          continue to have authority to prohibit
          use of the term when such use is false or

          misleading.
          FLA advises that it intends to defflne

          44high potency:: as a nutrient content
          claim in a separate rulemaying as quicyly
                                       .
          as possible. The agency ls postponing
          the date that it will apply this fflnal rule

          on nutrient content claims on dietary
          supplements until 'uly 11 1993. This

          postponement is discussed in detail in
          the document on the date of application

          for the nutrition labeling and nutrient
          content claim requirements for dietary

          supplements found elsewhere in this issue
          of the Federal hegister . FLA intends to

          complete its rulemaying on 44high
          potency:: in suMcient time to assure

          implementation by the time that dietary
          supplement manufacturers will be

          required to comply with the nutrient
          content claim provisions.





                               The agency also advises that the term
                                44high potencyl:: when used as part of a

                               brand name1 would fall under section
                               403(r)(2)(C) of the act1 if as the

                               comment stated1 it was used as part of
                               the brand name before October 231 19W9.

                               Nowever1 once this term is defflned by the.
                                Secretary1 lt will have to be used in a

                               manner that complies with that
                               defflnition. ln addition1 use of the term in
                               the brand name is subdect to section

                               403(a) of the act1 which prohibits the use
                               of false and misleading labeling

                               irrespective of whether the use of the
                               term in the brand name is exempt under

                               section 403(r)(2)(C) of the act.
                               As discussed previously1 the comments

                               did not demonstrate that there are
                                accepted defflnitions for any of these

                               terms. Nowever1 the comments have
                               convinced the agency that the terms
                                44high absorption:: and 44balanced:: do not

                               generally characterike the level of
                               nutrients. Accordingly1 the agency

                               concludes that these terms are not
                               subdect to section 403(r) of the act.

                               4. Age Specifflc Claims

                                3O. One comment stated that there are
                               products with brand names that imply

                               that the product is especially useful for a
                               particular segment of the population.
                               The comment argued that it would

                               therefore be appropriate for FLA to
                               require that these special formulas

                               comply with clearly defflned requirements
                                (e.g.1 that they contain high amounts of

                               particular vitamins and minerals that are
                               needed by the relevant group). Another

                               comment maintained that such names
                               mislead consumers because they provide
                               no explanation for those special

                               population claims1 and that in many
                               cases1 the supplements do not contain

                               levels of nutrients that are appropriate
                               for the special population named in the

                               claim. The comment suggested that FLA
                               should1 at the very least1 require labels to

                               provide an explanation for these claims.
                               For example1 an explanation for a

                               product with a brand name implying
                               that it is useful for women might state
                               that 44this product is especially suited for

                               young women because it contains 100
                               percent of the hLl for folic acid and iron





           and 30 percent of the hLl for calcium.::

           FLA agrees that products maryeted for
           special population groups may include

           claims or brand names that can be
           misleading. These claims and brand
           names seem to imply a particular benefflt

          for certain subgroups of the population
           and often do not disclose how or why

           they meet the needs of that particular
           subgroup. Lisclosure of such facts would

           help to protect a product from being
           misbranded under section 403(a) of the

           act because its labeling would reveal
           material facts about the product:s

           claimed special usefulness.
           Nowever1 such claims about the

           usefulness of a product for particular
           population groups generally fall under

           section 403(d) of the act to the extent
           that they represent the product to be for
           special dietary use. As special dietary

           use claims1 they are outside the scope of
           this rulemaying. Among other things1

           y103.3 defflnes 44special dietary uses:: as
           44uses for supplying particular dietary

           needs which exist by reason of a physical1

           condition1 including but not limited to
           the conditions of disease1 convalescence1

           and overweight; Sand] Su]ses for supplying
           particular dietary needs which exist by
           reason of age1 including but not limited

           to the ages of infancy and childhood::
           (y103.3(a)(l)(i) and (a)(l)(ii)). The

           agency intends to consider proposing
           regulations for such products. Nowever1

           because of resource constraints and other
           agency priorities1 any such proposal will

           not be available in the immediate future.
           ln the interim1 such claims will continue

           to be subdect to the general misbranding
           provisions of sections 201(n) and 403(a)

           of the act.
           3. 44Natural::

           3l. Several comments suggested that
           FLA defflne the term 44natural:: for

           dietary supplements because that term is
           widely used in the labeling of dietary

           supplements even though there is no
           established defflnition of that term1 and it
          ls misleading as it is now used. For.

           example1 one comment stated that





                                studies indicate that natural vitamin E
                                (d- alpha tocopherol) is better utiliked

                                than synthetic vitamin E (dl- alpha and
                                other tocopherols)1 but that 44natural::

                                claims now appear on products
                                containing synthetic vitamin E1

                                misleading consumers who thiny they are
                                getting a better utiliked product. The

                                comment stated that in other instances1
                                companies use the term 44natural:: to

                                mean that the product contains no
                                artifflcial ingredients.

                                One comment acynowledged that FLA
                                has struggled with how to defflne this

                                term for foods in conventional food form.
                                This comment suggested that the agency

                                need not resolve the dilemma at this
                                time1 but that it should simply establish

                                a supplement-specifflc defflnition1 dust as
                                FLA has established a special defflnition
                               for 44natural fflavor:: in y101.22. Another

                                comment suggested that FLA should
                                allow 44natural:: claims on products

                                containing only the naturally occurring
                               form of a vitamin. The comment

                                suggested that FLA could request
                                comments about whether to limit

                                44natural:: claims to nutrients1 such as
                                vitamin E1 that appear to offer some

                                advantage when consumed in a natural
                               form. The comment also stated that

                                many consumers will want the option of
                                purchasing other nutrients in the natural
                               form as well.

                                FLA is not persuaded by the comments

                                that the term 44natural:: should be
                                defflned at this time. As one comment
                                acynowledged1 the agency has recently

                                expended its resources exploring the use
                                of this term1 and it was unable to arrive

                                at an acceptable defflnition (3W Fh 2302
                                at 2401). FLA currently lacys suMcient

                                resources to thoroughly explore and
                                develop proposed regulations for the use

                                of this term on dietary supplements.
                                ln the fflnal rule on nutrient content

                                claims1 the agency determined that it
                                would maintain its current policy (as

                                discussed in the general principles
                                proposal (30 Fh 00421 at 00400) of

                               interpreting this term to mean that
                                nothing artifflcial or synthetic (including

                                all color additives regardless of source)
                                has been included in1 or has been added





          to1 a food (hef. 1). FLA also decided
          that it would continue to distinguish

          between natural and artifflcial fflavors as
          outlined in y101.22. The agency

          concludes that1 for the reasons cited
          above1 it is appropriate to apply this

          policy to dietary supplements.
          ln this regard1 FLA also points out that

          y101.9(y)(O) states that a food labeled
          under the provisions of this section shall

          be deemed to be misbranded under
          sections 201(n) and 403(a) of the act if
          its label or labeling represents1 suggests1

          or implies1 44that a natural vitamin in a
          food is superior to an added or synthetic

          vitamin or to differentiate in any way
          between vitamins naturally present from

          those added.::
          V. Other provisions

          FLA did not receive any comments that
          dealt specifflcally with the other

          provisions of the proposal. ln the absence
          of any basis for doing otherwise1 FLA is
          adoptlng those provisions as proposed..

          Vl. Economic lmpact

          ln its dietary supplement labeling
          proposals of 'une 1W1 19931 FLA stated
          that the proposed rules on the labeling of

          dietary supplements1 tayen as a whole1
          would have associated costs of

          approximately t20 million. Thus1 the
          agency concluded that the proposed rules

          would not constitute a mador rule as
          defflned by Executive Order 12291. ln

          accordance with the hegulatory
          Flexibility Act (pub. L. 9O-334)1 FLA

          explored whether the proposed rules may
          have a signifflcant impact on small
          businesses and tentatively concluded that

          they do not.
          FLA has evaluated the many comments

          that it received in response to its
          economic impact analysls. because the.

          issues raised in the comments relate to
          all three proposals1 FLA has combined

          its discussion of these comments and
          presented them in the fflnal rule regarding

          the date of application published
          elsewhere in this issue of the Federal
          hegister .

          FLA has examined the economic
          implications of the fflnal rules amending

          21 CFh as required by Executive Order
          12W00 and the hegulatory Flexibility





                                Act. Executive Order 12W00 directs

                                agencies to assess all costs and benefflts of
                                available regulatory alternatives and1
                                when regulation is necessary1 to select

                                regulatory approaches that maximike net
                                benefflts (including potential economic1

                                effects; distributive impacts; and equlty)..

                                The hegulatory Flexibility Act requires
                                the agency to analyke options for

                                regulatory relief for small businesses.
                                FLA has concluded1 based on its review

                                of the available data and comments1 that
                                these fflnal rules are not signifflcant as

                                defflned by Executive Order 12W00.
                                Further1 in accordance with the

                                hegulatory Flexibility Act1 the agency
                                certiffles that these fflnal rules will not

                                have a signifflcant impact on a substantial
                                number of small businesses.

                                Vll. Environmental lmpact
                                The agency has determined under 21

                                CFh 23.24(a)(11) that this action is of a
                                type that does not individually or

                                cumulatively have a signifflcant effect on
                                the human environment. Therefore1

                                neither an environmental assessment nor
                                an environmental impact statement is
                                required.

                                FLA announced that the agency had

                                submitted to the OMce of Management
                                and budget (OMb) for its review the

                                information burden for this provision.
                                None of the more than 300 comments

                                received in response to the dietary

          aspects of the 1990 amendments is their

          confflrmation of FLA:s authority to
          regulate health claims on food labels and

          in food labeling. The new provisions
          amended the act by adding a provision1

          section 403(r)(l)(b) (21 U.S.C.
          343(r)(l)(b))1 that provides that a
          product is misbranded if it bears a claim

          that characterikes the relationship of a
          nutrient to a disease or health-related
          condition1 unless the claim is made in

          accordance with sections 403(r)(3) of the





                                act (which pertains to foods in
                                conventional food form) or 403(r)(3)(L)

                                (which pertains to dietary supplements).
                                Congress enacted the health claims

                                provisions of the 1990 amendments to
                                help U.S. consumers maintain healthy

                                dietary practices and to protect these
                                consumers from unfounded health claims.

          Many of the comments pertained to
          dietary supplements. The agency

          summariked and addressed the issues
          raised in the comments in the fflnal rule

          on health claims that published in the
          Federal hegister of 'anuary 01 1993 (3W
          Fh 241W) (hereinafter referred to as 44the

          health claims fflnal rule:: ). The health
          claims fflnal rule became effective on May

          W1 1993.
          Although the health claims proposal

          pertained to dietary supplements as well
          as foods in conventional food form1 the

          fflnal rule applied only to the latter type
          of foods. ln October of 19921 Congress
          passed the LS act (pub. L. 102-311)1

          which imposed a moratorium on FLA
          implementation of the 1990 amendments

          with respect to dietary supplements until
          Lecember 131 1993. The LS act provides
          that by 'une 131 19931 FLA was to have

          issued proposed rules to implement the
          1990 amendments with respect to dietary

          supplements1 and that by Lecember 311
          19931 the agency is to issue fflnal rules

          based on these proposals. The LS act
          also amends the 1990 amendments to
          refflect the fact that if the agency does

          not issue fflnal rules with respect to
          health claims for dietary supplements by

          Lecember 311 19931 the proposed
          regulations are to be considered fflnal

          regulations at that time.
          ln the Federal hegister of 'une 1W1 1993

          (3W Fh 33100)1 FLA responded to the
          LS act by issuing a proposal that sets
          forth a standard and procedure for

          maying health claims for dietary
          supplements (hereinafter referred to as

          44the dietary supplement health claims
          proposal:: ). ln that proposal1 FLA

          proposed to maye health claims on
          dietary supplements subdect to the same
          general requirements that apply to

          health claims on all other types of food.
          ln response to the dietary supplement

          over 11200 letters1 each containing one or

                               comments disagreed with one or more

                               heview of the 1990 Amendments
                               The 1990 amendments did not provide a

                               specifflc standard for when a health claim
                               should be authoriked on dietary

                               supplements or a specifflc procedure for
                               authoriking such claims. Under section

                               establishment of such a standard and
                               such a procedure is left to the Secretary

                               legislative history of the 1990

                               amendments to identify the features that
                               Congress intended would guide the

                               believes should guide its choice:

                               o The regulations are to deal only with
                               the procedure and standard for health





          claims for the substances in dietary

          supplements. They are to have no
          bearing on the availability of any dietary
          supplements.

          o The regulations must prohibit the use

          of health claims that are not authoriked
          under their provisions.

          o The regulations must ensure that any
          health claims that appear in labeling are
          scientifflcally valid.

          o The regulations must ensure that any

          health claims that appear in labeling are
          understandable.

          o The regulations should be such that all
          segments of the food industry are treated
          fairly and in a consistent manner1 unless

          there is an appropriate basis on which to
          draw a distinction. This factor embodies
                               .
          a principle of equlty implicitly in the act.
          (3W Fh 33100 at 33103)

          With these features in mind1 FLA
          considered all of the approaches of which
          .
          lt was aware that might be used to
          regulate dietary supplements. The

          agency tentatively concluded that it
          should adopt an approach that would

          subdect dietary supplements to the same
          standard that applies to foods in

          conventional food form. FLA stated that
          lt was its tentative view that that.

          approach striyes the appropriate balance
          between the congressional concern for

          consumer fraud1 public health1 and sound
          science1 on the one hand1 and the desire

          to provide the consumer with information
          on the other. Furthermore1 the agency

          advised that if it adopts this standard for
          dietary supplements1 all foods will be
          regulated under the same standard.

          FLA pointed out that under the same

          procedure that applies with respect to
          claims for substances in food in
          conventional food form1 there is a

          premaryet review that ensures that the
          safety of the substance that is to be the

          subdect of the claim has been established
          as well as the scientifflc validity of the

          claim. A claim linying a substance to a
          disease1 whether on a food in

          conventional food form or on a dietary
          supplement1 is intended to increase intaye

          of that substance. Thus1 the agency said1
          it is important to ensure that a claim

          encouraging such increased intaye can be





                               safely implemented. Therefore1 FLA

                               proposed to adopt the same procedure

                               for health claims for dietary supplements

                               as for foods in conventional food form.

                               1. Availability of Lietary Supplements


                               1. A great many comments1 primarily

                               from consumers1 raised ob3.ections that

                               indicated that the commenters were

                               misinformed about the proposed

                               regulations1 or that they simply did not

                               believe what FLA stated in the dietary

                               supplement proposal. Many of the

                               comments expressed considerable anger1

                               resentment1 and even fear over the

                               proposal. A large number of these

                               comments characteriked the proposal as

                               an attacy against the dietary supplement


                               industry. Many of these comments stated

                               that FLA is plotting to ban all dietary

                               supplements. A number of comments

                               explained that the proposed regulations

                               would limit the number of dietary

                               supplements available to consumers by

                               limiting the amount of health

                               information that could appear on

                               supplement labels and thus diminish

                               supplements: maryetability. The

                               comments maintained that FLA:s

                               proposed policy of requiring premaryet

                               review of a supplement:s safety is

                               contrary to the agency:s stated intent to


                               preserve supplement availability and

                               consumer choice. Some of the comments

                               maintained that many manufacturers

                               would be put out of business. Many of

                               the comments argued that the nation:s

                               health would be adversely affected1 and

                               that health care costs would increase

                               without dietary supplements to maintain

                               good health. Some comments contained

                               testimonials that certain dietary

                               supplements were responsible for curing

                               and preventing a variety of diseases1

                               including cancer.


                               Nowever1 a few comments pointed out

                               that assertions that FLA plans to ban

                               dietary supplements are unfounded. A

                               number of these comments predicted

                               that the vast ma3.ority of dietary

                               supplements will remain in the

                               maryetplace because about W0 percent of

                               supplement labels are already in

                               compliance with the proposed provisions.


                               There is no basis for virtually all of the





          concerns raised in the comments about

          the availability of dietary supplements.
                     .
          Nothing ln these regulations will maye

          them unavailable to consumers. These

          regulations focus only on ensuring that

          health claims1 if made on the labels or in

          the labeling of dietary supplements1 are

          scientifflcally valid and understandable.

          Thus1 the availability of dietary


          supplements will not be affected by these

          regulations. While it is liyely that some

          claims may have to be removed from

          product labeling as a result of this fflnal

          rule1 the products themselves can

          continue to be maryeted.

          lt is true that prohibiting the use of

          claims that have not been authoriked by

          FLA may have an adverse impact on the

          maryetability of some products.

          Nowever1 any such impact is outweighed


          by the need to assure consumers that the

          claims that are made in labeling are

          scientifflcally valid1 and that they can rely

          on such claims. ln fact1 the only

          products whose maryetability will

          ultimately suffer under these regulations

          will be those whose labeling has borne

          claims that cannot be supported by the

          available scientifflc evidence.

          The requirement that the agency be

          conffldent that the presence of a health


          claim will not result in unsafe intayes of

          the substance that is the sub3.ect of the

          claim is not inconsistent with supplement

          availability and consumer choice. lf a

          manufacturer does not choose to maye a

          claim about a substance1 nothing in these

          regulations will affect the manufacturer:s

          ability to continue to maryet

          supplements that contain that substance.

          FLA believes1 however1 that it has an

          obligation to ensure that before it

          authorikes a claim that encourages

          consumers to increase their consumption


          of a substance1 it have some assurance

          that increased consumption of that

          substance will not be harmful.

          2. Fair and Consistent Treatment of All

          Segments of the Food lndustry

          2. Many comments asserted that FLA

          has not been evenhanded in its approval

          of health claims for use on dietary


          supplements and on foods in

          conventional food form. Some of these





                                comments maintained that FLA:s unfair
                                treatment of dietary supplements is

                                evidenced by the agency:s approval of
                                health claims involving cancer and

                                coronary heart disease for use on fruits1
                                vegetables1 and grain products but not

                               for use on fortiffled foods or supplements
                                that provide fflber or antioxidant

                                vitamins. The comments stated that
                                FLA should authorike health claims
                               involving particular nutrients for use on

                                any food that contains those nutrients1
                               including dietary supplements1 unless

                                there is signifflcant scientifflc agreement
                                that the claim is valid only when the

                                nutrient is consumed in a particular
                               form. To ensure that such an approach is

                                tayen in evaluating health claims for use
                                on dietary supplements in the future1 a

                               few comments requested that FLA add.
                                the followlng provision to the end of

                                y101.14(g) (21 CFh 101.14(g)):
                                A health claim that has been approved

                               for any substance that is to be consumed
                                at other than decreased dietary levels

                                shall be permitted on all foods (including
                                dietary supplements) containing the
                                requisite amounts of that substance1

                                unless FLA determines that (i) there is
                                signifflcant scientifflc agreement (as

                                defflned in subparagraph (c)) that the
                                consumption of the substance in the

                                particular food will not provide the
                                benefflts claimed1 or (ii) the food contains

                                disqualifying amounts of another
                                substance.

                                A few comments contended that FLA
                                also has treated dietary supplements

                                unfairly by withholding approval of a
                                health claim concerning the role of folic

                                acid in reducing the risy of neural tube
                                defects (NTL:s) simply because of its
                                                      .
                                concerns that allowlng the claim on foods.
                               ln conventional food form would raise
                                safety issues because of overfortifflcation

                                of the food supply and the subsequent
                                effect on certain subpopulations. These

                                comments asserted that the proper
                                course of action for the agency would

                                have been to allow health claims on
                                dietary supplements but to prohibit their

                                use on foods in conventional food form
                                until the public health concerns

                                associated with such use had been





          resolved.

          Nowever1 a few comments supported
          FLA:s decision to approve particular

          health claims for use on fruits1
          vegetables1 and fflber-containing grains

          while not authoriking their use on dietary
          supplements or fortiffled foods with added

          antioxidant vitamins or fflber. These
          comments noted that there are many

          compounds in fruits and vegetables that
          may be involved in reducing the risy of

          disease that may not have been
          identiffled. The comments asserted that
                         .
          before allowlng a dietary supplement to
          bear a health claim authoriked for use on

          food in conventional food form1 it is
          important to establish that the

          supplement provides the same health
          protection benefflts as the conventional

          food.
          FLA disagrees with the assertions in the

          comments that it has been unfair with
          the dietary supplement industry with

          respect to its approval of specifflc health
          claims. FLA believes that the health

          claims should be consistent with the
          scientifflc evidence available to the agency.

          ln the Federal hegister of 'anuary 01
           1993 (3W Fh 23311 23321 and 2022)1 FLA

          explained why it was authoriking health
          claims pertaining to: (l) Neart disease
          and diets low in saturated fat and

          cholesterol and high in fruits1 vegetables1
          and grain products that contain fflber; (2)

          cancer and diets low in fat and high in
          fruits1 vegetables1 and grain products

          that contain fflber; and (3) cancer and
          diets low in fat and high in fruits and

          vegetables that may contain fflber1
          vitamin A ( beta -carotene) and vitamin

          C. The agency also explained in detail
          why it was not authoriking health claims

          pertaining to any specifflc nutrients (i.e.1
          heart disease and dietary fflber1 cancer

          and dietary fflber1 and cancer and
          antioxidant vitamins).

          ln the case of the antioxidant vitamins1
          FLA found that although there was

          suMcient evidence to dustify a health
          claim concerning the relationship

          between diets low in fat and high in fruits
          and vegetables that may contain fflber1

          vitamin A1 and vitamin C and a reduced
          risy of cancer1 the available evidence did





                                 not provide a basis on which to attribute

                                 the reduction in risy of disease to any
                                 individual vitamin or combination of

                                 vitamins1 regardless of whether the
                                 vitamin is classiffled as an antioxidant or

                                 not (see discussion under section lV.1 3W
                                 Fh 2022 at 2033). yet1 because of the

                                 usefulness of vitamins A (as beta
                                 -carotene) and C and dietary fflber in

                                 identifying those fruits and vegetables

                                 that correlate with reduced cancer risy1
                                 FLA identiffled these nutrients as being

                                 characteristic of the foods associated
                                 with a protective effect. Any one or a

                                 combination of these three nutrients can
                                 serve as the identifying maryer.

                                 Moreover1 because fruits and vegetables
                                 are also characteriked by an absence of

                                 fat1 and because of the identiffled
                                 relationship of low fat diets to reduced

                                 risy of cancer1 FLA highlighted low fat
                                 intayes as part of the dietary pattern

                                 associated with decreased cancer risy.
                                 because the mechanism of the protective

                                 effect of fruits and vegetables is not
                                 ynown1 and because it is not possible to

                                 determine which of the nutrients or other
                                 components in fruits and vegetables is

                                 causing the observed effect1 the health
                                 claim authoriked by FLA focuses on

                                 fruits and vegetables as a class of foods
                                 and their relationship to cancer risy1 and

                                 not on particular nutrients. by requiring
                                 that all characteriking nutrients be

                                 identiffled as characteristic of dietary
                                 patterns rich in fruits and vegetables

                                 without specifflcally attributing reduced
                                 cancer risy to a slngle nutrient or single.

                                 type of nutrient (antioxidant vitamins)1
                                 FLA made the claim consistent with the

                                 scientifflc ynowledge available to it at the
                                 time it authoriked the claim.

                                 because of the rapidly evolving science

                                 base relative to this topic1 however1 FLA
                                 has continued to update its evaluation of

                                 the scientifflc evidence and the degree of
                                 scientifflc agreement on the relationship

                                 between antioxidant vitamins and cancer.
                                 As part of these efforts1 FLA initiated1

                                 along with other mador research and

                                 health organikations as cosponsors1 a
                                 public conference on antioxidant vitamins

                                 and cancer and cardiovascular disease
                                 that was held on November 1 through 31





           1993. The transcript of that meeting has

          been submitted to the Locyet as a
          comment on the antioxidant vitamins

          and cancer rulemaying1 along with other
          comments received in response to the
          announcement of the conference (3W Fh

          343931 October 221 1993). FLA is
          reviewlng the results of this conference.

          and other scientifflc evidence that has
          become publicly available since the

          publication of the 'anuary 01 19931 fflnal
          rule on antioxidant vitamins and cancer.

          Similarly1 in the case of heart disease and

          dietary fflber and of cancer and dietary
          fflber1 the agency found that there was
          insuMcient evidence to attribute the

          reduction in risy specifflcally to dietary
          fflber or to specifflc fflber components. The

          agency did conclude1 however1 that
          dietary fflber and soluble fflber1 along with

          other nutrients1 serve as useful maryers
          in identifying those foods for which the

          scientifflc evidence showed that inclusion
          ln a daily diet was associated with.

          reduced risy of cancer and of heart
          disease (3W Fh 2332 and 3W Fh 2331).

          For both topic areas1 the agency also
          noted the inability of commonly used

          analytical methodologies to detect many
          of the characteristics that vary among

          dietary fflbers and that may be related to
          biological function (e.g.1 particle sike1

          chemical composition1 water-holding
          capacity). With regard to heart disease1

          other components variable associated
          with soluble fflber in foods (e.g.1 lipid

          components) may also contribute to a

          that the inability to detect many of the
          differences among fflbers1 fflber

          components1 and other substances in
          foods that contain dietary fflbers1

          including soluble fflber1 and the general
          lacy of conclusions as to the mechanism
          of action of dietary fflbers and fflber

          components were limiting factors on
          FLA:s ability to draw conclusions from

          the available evidence. Furthermore1
          FLA noted that foods high in dietary

          fflber are also generally low in calories
          and total fat1 factors that are associated

          with reduced risy of cancer. Fiber-rich
          foods are also generally low in saturated

          fats and cholesterol1 substances that also





                                affect the risy of developing heart

                                disease. Thus1 some or all of the benefflts
                                associated with diets high in fflber-rich

                                foods could be the result of displacement
                                of fat and saturated fat from the total

                                diet rather than an effect of fflber per se.
                                The agency stated that although the

                                of heart disease and cancer. Thus1 FLA

                                did not authorike the use of a health

                                consumption is most liyely to correlate

                                with decreased cancer or heart disease

                                evidence of a direct effect of fflber.

                                FLA is aware1 however1 of the rapidly
                                evolving nature of the science base

                                relative to these topic areas. FLA
                                intends to update its review of the

                                science by initiating1 in the near future1
                                along with other mador research and

                                health organikations as cosponsors1 a
                                public symposium on dietary fflber and

                                heart disease and cancer.
                                With respect to assertions concerning

                                folic acid1 FLA disagrees that it should
                                have allowed health claims on dietary

                                supplements while prohibiting their use
                                on foods in conventional food form.

                                While FLA did not authorike a health
                                claim for folic acid and NTL:s1 in the

                                fflnal rule on heath claims and label





          statements for folic acid and NTL:s
          published in the Federal hegister of

          'anuary 01 1993 (3W Fh 2000)
           (hereinafter referred to as 44the folic acid

          fflnal rule:: )1 the agency did announce its
          plans to wory expeditiously to authorike
           a claim1 if appropriate.

          The agency noted that the public Nealth

           Service (pNS)1 including FLA1 had
          recommended (hef. 1) that all women of
          childbearing age in the United States

          should consume 0.4 milligram (mg) (400
          micrograms (pg)) of folic acid daily to

          reduce their risy of having a pregnancy
           affected with spina bifflda or other neural

          tube defects. FLA acynowledges that
          this recommendation evidenced that
          signifflcant scientifflc agreement existed

          regarding a relationship between folate
           and NTL:s but said that there were

          factors that prevented FLA from
           authoriking a claim. The agency said

          that the act must be read as a whole1
           and that sections 403(r)(3)(A)(ii) and

          409 of the act (21 U.S.C. 34W) refflect the
          proposition that the use of a substance
          that is the subdect of a health claim must

          be safe. The agency pointed out that the
          pNS recommendation stated that there

          were signifflcant questions that persist
           about the safe use of folic acid in food.

          As stated in the folic acid fflnal rule1 FLA
          expected that the authorikation of a
          claim would liyely result in signifflcant

          increases in consumption of folic acid by
          women in their childbearing years and by

          the general population1 because
          manufacturers would add folic acid to

          their products in order to claim that
          these products were useful in reducing

          the risy of birth defects. lntayes of
          multiple doses of folic acid from
          supplements and from its increased

          presence in the food supply could rapidly
          result in intayes of 3 to 1 mg (31000 to

           11000 pg) per day (3W Fh 2000 at 2014).
           Such intayes represent increases of

           1O-fold or more above current intayes.
          ln the folic acid fflnal rule1 the agency

          reviewed the safety considerations raised
          by such increases in folic acid intayes1

          including: (l) potential effects in persons
          with poor vitamin b12 status; (2)
          potential risys for persons taying





                                medications that interfere with folate
                                metabolism; (3) potential risys for

                                pregnant women because of uncertainties
                                about effects of high blood levels of folic

                                acid on the embryo during gestation; and
                                (4) uncertainties regarding possible

                                interactions between folic acid and other
                                nutrients with increased folic acid

                                intayes. The agency concluded that it
                                could not authorike a health claim on

                                folic acid until the questions regarding
                                the safe use of this nutrient were

                                satisfactorily resolved. ln the folic acid
                                fflnal rule the agency described the efforts
                                lt was undertaying to address and resolve.

                                these concerns.
                                        .
                                Followlng publication of this document1
                                based on its review of the evidence1 its

                                discussions with an advisory committee1
                                and its review of the comments that it

                                received1 the agency tentatively
                                concluded that the safety problems raised
                                by folic acid can be resolved by setting a

                                safe upper limit of intaye of 1 mg folate
                                per day for all population groups. The

                                agency announced its tentative
                                conclusion in a proposal to authorike a

                                health claim on folate and neural tube
                                defects (3W Fh 332341 October 141 1993).

                                ln companion documents1 FLA also
                                proposed to amend the food additive

                                regulation for folic acid to specify the
                                foods that could be fortiffled with folic

                                acid and the level at which they could be
                                fortiffled (3W Fh 33312) and to amend the
                                standards of identity for specifflc

                                cereal-grain products to permit the
                                addition of folic acid (3W Fh 33303).

                                Thus1 based on this review of the

                                agency:s actions1 it is clear that the
                                nondiscriminatory provision suggested in

                                the comments is not necessary. When
                                FLA has concluded that a substance has
                                a relationship to a disease1 FLA has

                                acted to authorike a claim (see fflnal rule
                                on calcium and osteoporosis (3W Fh

                                2003) and the proposed rule on folic acid
                                and neural tube defects (3W Fh 33234)).

                                ln the case of antioxidant vitamins and
                                cancer1 dietary fflber and heart disease1

                                and dietary fflber and cancer1 the
                                evidence did not establish that the

                                named substances had an effect on the
                                named diseases. The evidence showed





          that these nutrients were merely maryers
          of foods that had been shown in studies

          to affect the risy of the disease. FLA has
          refflected the scientifflc evidence in the

          claims that it has authoriked and
          proposed to authorike. Any other course

          of action would be inconsistent with the
          act because it would result in claims that
          were both not scientifflcally valid and

          misleading.

          b. Alternative Approaches
          ln the dietary supplement health claims

          proposal (3W Fh 33100 at 33103)1 FLA
          advised that a variety of approaches had
          come to FLA:s attention about how

          health claims for dietary supplements
          would best be regulated under the 1990

          amendments. These approaches came to
          the agency:s attention by various means1

          including the comments on the health
          claims proposal that addressed the most

          appropriate method for regulating
          dietary supplements1 testimony before
          Congress about implementation of the

          1990 amendments1 as well as the
          legislative history of the 1990

          amendments. FLA carefully evaluated
          each of these approaches to determine

          how they compare with the
          characteristics that FLA has listed

          above. A number of comments addressed
          the agency:s tentative conclusions about

          these approaches.
          1. Use of Advisory Committees

          ln the dietary supplement health claims
          proposal (see section ll.b.l.1 3W Fh

          33100 at 33104)1 FLA advised that it
          had tentatively decided not to adopt a
          committee-based approach suggested in

          comments for evaluating the validity of
          health claims on herbs. This approach1

          ynown as the botanical lngredient
          heview (blh)1 would involve the

          establishment of expert panels under the
          direction of an oversight committee.

          FLA would participate as a nonvoting
          member of the expert panels. The

          oversight committee1 which would be
          charged with the responsibility of
          reviewlng all health claim petitions.

          pertaining to herb or botanical
          components1 would relieve FLA of all

          responsibility for initial review of these
          petitions. Each expert panel would





                               conduct an evaluation of scientifflc data

                               pertaining to the requested claim1

                               sub3.ect the evaluation to peer review1

                               and prepare a fflnal recommendation

                               about the claim. The recommendation

                               and all supporting documents would then

                               be forwarded to FLA1 and the agency

                               would be permitted 120 days to approve1

                               disapprove1 or modify the report. Under


                               draft regulations prepared and submitted

                               for FLA adoption by one comment on

                               the health claims proposal1 there would

                               be a codiffled presumption in favor of the

                               committee recommendation.

                               The agency based its tentative decision

                               about the blh on its belief that the

                               suggested approach would involve a


                               signifflcant transfer of agency authority

                               on health claims because of this

                               presumption in the draft regulations

                               submitted by the comment. Under this

                               presumption1 FLA would be obligated to
                                                                          .
                               prove that the committee was wrong lf

                               the agency decided not to follow the

                               committee:s recommendation. ln such

                               circumstances1 FLA could be forced to

                               propose to authorike health claims that it

                               was not satisffled were scientifflcally valid.

                               FLA noted that there is no basis under

                               the act for such a transfer. Also1 the

                               agency noted that the creation of such a


                               committee would be fflnancially

                               burdensome and stated that it would be

                               inappropriate to commit its limited

                               resources to a committee with as narrow

                               a scope as that suggested by the

                               comment.

                               3. A few comments addressed this

                               advisory committee issue. Some


                               comments voiced opposition to FLA:s

                               tentative decision not to establish a blh.

                               These comments disputed the agency:s

                               assertion that the establishment of a blh

                               would involve any transfer of authority1

                               noting that FLA would retain full and

                               fflnal discretion in approving health

                               claims. The comments also disputed

                               FLA:s fflnding that the creation of a blh

                               would be burdensome and costly in light

                               of the agency:s limited resources. The
                                                                          .
                               comments stated that such a fflnding ls

                               inconsistent with FLA:s current use of


                               advisory committees for very narrow

                               sub3.ect matters such as over-the-counter





          (OTC) antiplaque products1 circulatory

          system medical devices1 and drug abuse.
          The comments stated that the use of a
          blh to help screen petitions from the

          much larger herbal products industry
          would be an eMcient1 economical1 and

          scientifflcally credible way to ration
          FLA:s scarce resources and would also

          help FLA meet statutorily-imposed
          deadlines for actions on petitions that it

          might not otherwise be able to meet.

          The comments also asserted that the
          agency:s statement that it has the
           44ultimate responsibility to determine

          whether the petitioned-for health claim is
          valid:: implies a mistrust of the integrlty  .

          of the blh process and the involved
          scientists and reveals an agency belief

          that it is the only authority competent to
          dudge the scientifflc validity of health

          claims for herbal dietary supplements.
          The comments disagreed with such a

          conclusion and argued that health claim
          petitions will only receive adequate and

          full consideration from the scientifflc
          community best qualiffled to determine

          whether they meet the signifflcant
          scientifflc agreement standard set by

          Congress through the creation of a blh1
          which would represent the most
          competent and ynowledgeable body in a

          ffleld that remains largely esoteric to
          FLA. One of these comments suggested

          that appropriate selections for herbal
          experts panels might include experienced

          herbal practitioners who are familiar
          with potential adverse reactions to herbs

          as well as medical practitioners in foreign
          countries where herb safety has been

          studied by government and industry
          panels. The comment stated that the

          inclusion of foreign medical practitioners
          would be especially appropriate during

          the evaluation of a claim whose merits
          are agreed upon throughout the world

          but are not generally recogniked in the
          United States1 such as in the case of
          using peppermint tea for its soothing or

          carminative effects on the digestive tract.

          Nowever1 one comment supported the
          agency:s tentative decision not to adopt

          the blh process. The comment stated
          that FLA could well be legally liable for

          decisions made by the blh that were





                               later shown to have placed the public

                               health at risy.

                               Several comments called for FLA to

                               establish an advisory committee for

                               health claims for dietary supplements

                               where the committee would select expert


                               panels responsible for the evaluation of

                               proposed health claims for all dietary

                               supplements. The comments suggested

                               that the expert panels should be

                               composed of scientists and health care

                               professionals with expertise on a given

                               nutrient-disease relationship as well as

                               nonvoting industry and consumer

                               representatives. These comments

                               contended that one reason for the

                               agency:s slowness in approving a health

                               claim for folic acid has been its reliance

                               on advisory panels that were not


                               suMciently familiar with the research in

                               the area and who had to be educated

                               about the strength of the evidence before

                               they could act. Some of these comments

                               suggested that FLA could retain the

                               authority to re3.ect the recommendations

                               of the committee1 as long as it published

                               its reasons for doing so.

                               Another comment stated that both the

                               dietary supplement industry and FLA


                               have been slow to recognike and utilike a

                               great deal of research that has been done

                               in the area of nutrition and health. The

                               comment attributed this slowness to a

                               gap between the scientifflc community1

                               FLA1 and the dietary supplement

                               industry. The comment suggested that in

                               order to close this gap1 FLA should form

                               a committee of its leading scientists to

                               meet with a similar industry committee

                               every 3 to 0 months1 or as required1 to

                               discuss the latest research in the area of

                               nutrition and health published in highly

                               accredited scientifflc 3.ournals so that the


                               research could be used to create and

                               support health claim petitions. The

                               comment suggested that when the

                               agency committee and the industry reach

                               an agreement on the data1 FLA could

                               authorike the use of a health claim on

                               the nutrient-disease relationship on

                               which there is agreement.

                               FLA recognikes that advisory


                               committees may maye valuable

                               contributions in assisting the agency to





          evaluate scientifflc evidence about health

          claims in certain circumstances. For

          example1 the Folic Acid Subcommittee of

          the Food Advisory Committee provided

          valuable recommendations in support of

          FLA proposing to authorike a health

          claim for folic acid and proposing to

          fortify cereal-grain products. The agency

          intends to continue its use of advisory


          committees wherever the need arises.

          FLA believes1 however1 that it should

          retain the right to decide when the use of

          an advisory committee is necessary.

          There may frequently be circumstances
          .
          ln which evidence establishes that use of

          advisory committees is not necessary

          because the evidence shows that the


          claim is clearly supported or clearly not

          supported. ln addition1 if the agency

          were to establish a standing advisory

          committee for health claims1 FLA would

          want it to have a broader focus than 3.ust

          dietary supplements. FLA:s view is that

          claims should focus on the substance1

          and not the food in which it is found1

          because the primary issue is whether the

          substance-disease relationship has been

          established. Thus1 if FLA were to

          establish a standing advisory committee1

          lt would be on health claims in general..

          Although a number of comments asserted


          that FLA lacys ynowledge of herbal

          products1 the agency believes that its

          personnel are fully competent to evaluate

          properly substantiated petitions

          concerning health claims in this area.

          Also1 if the agency were to decide to
                                                   .
          establish an advisory committee1 lt

          would taye steps to ensure that the

          membership of the committee had the

          necessary expertise1 including pertinent

          expertise on herbal products.


          There is an implication in some of the

          comments that the evaluation of the

          scientifflc evidence supporting a claim is

          somehow different depending on the

          substance involved. ln fact1 whether a

          claim is for a vitamin1 mineral1 herb1 or

          other similar nutritional substance1

          including fat1 saturated fat1 and

          cholesterol1 the syills needed for

          evaluation of a claim are basically the


          same. These syills are found in

          epidemiologists1 nutritionists1





                               biostatisticians1 clinicians1 and experts in

                               the disease being addressed1 as well as in
                               people aware of how the substance is1 or

                               should be1 consumed. Thus1 FLA does
                               not agree with the implication in these
                               comments.

                               FLA is interested in having

                               communication with the dietary
                               supplement industry. Nowever1 the

                               agency does not believe that it would be
                               appropriate for the communication to
                               taye the form of the suggested standing

                               committee to meet with a similar
                               industry committee every 3 to 0 months.

                               While FLA believes that regular
                               communication with the dietary

                               supplement industry is liyely to be
                               useful1 the process by which health

                               claims are authoriked must be a more
                               open and public process than that

                               suggested by the comment. Certainly the
                                1990 amendments envisioned a public

                               process for claims for substances in foods.
                               ln conventional food form1 as refflected in

                               section 403(r)(4) of the act. FLA has
                               been presented with no convincing reason

                               why a similar process should not apply
                               to claims for substances in dietary
                               supplements.

                               Furthermore1 FLA continues to believe

                               that the blh advisory committee
                               approach would involve a signifflcant

                               transfer of agency authority for health
                               claims1 even though comments on the
                               health claims proposal and the dietary

                               supplement health claims proposal have
                               made arguments to the contrary. The

                               suggested regulation for health claims
                               that was submitted to FLA on May 101
                                                                          .
                                19911 and referred to by the agency ln
                               the proposals that it has issued1 states in

                               part:
                               b. lf the Committee determines that a

                               proposed health claim is appropriate for
                               a particular herb or botanical1 either as

                               proposed or as modiffled by the
                               Committee1 it shall forward its

                               recommendation(s) to FLA together
                               with all the data and other information

                               before the Committee when it made its
                               decision.

                               C. lf the Committee determines that1 on
                               the basis of the data1 and other

                               information before it1 the proposed





          health claim is not scientifflcally dustiffled
          for the herb or botanical1 it shall so

          notify the proposer. The proposer may
          then direct the Committee to forward to

          FLA all the information before the
          Committee with respect to the proposal

          together with its conclusions and the
          reasons therefore.

          L. Within 120 days of receipt of the
          information described in (b) and (C)

          above1 FLA shall either accept the
          recommendation1 redect it1 or modify it

          based upon the Agency:s independent
          evaluation with analysis and reasons for

          redection or modifflcation of recommended
          health claims. ln arriving at its decision
          FLA may consider data or information

          other than that before the Committee.
          There shall be a presumption1 to be

          sustained when the record is viewed as a
          whole1 in favor of a Committee

          recommendation under either (b) or (C).
          (Emphasis added.)

          Lespite assertions to the contrary1 the
          last sentence of paragraph 44L:: obligates

          FLA to establish that the committee was
          wrong ln order not to follow the.

          committee:s recommendation.
          Ultimately1 therefore1 there would1 in

          fact1 be a signifflcant transfer of authority
          if the suggested provision were to be

          adopted by FLA. As FLA noted in the
          dietary supplement health claims
          proposal (3W Fh 33100 at 33104)1 there is

          no basis under the act for such a transfer
          of authority.

          FLA does not question that experts on
          an industry committee or panel on herbs

          and botanicals could be helpful. The
          agency encourages fflrms to wory through

          such groups. For this reason1 FLA
          revised the provision pertaining to

          petitions in the health claims fflnal rule to
          clarify that the agency will consider all

          recommendations by such committees
          and panels (see y101.10(b)). FLA

          recognikes that those petitions that have
          undergone an independent scientifflc
          review and received endorsement by

          qualiffled expert groups will liyely be
          well-supported petitions and could be

          very persuasive to FLA. Further1 FLA is
          liyely to place considerable weight on the

          recommendations of outside experts1 and





                                its decision as to whether a petition
                                should be granted could be inffluenced

                                signifflcantly by these experts.
                                Although FLA encourages fflrms to wory

                                through groups of outside experts1 the
                                agency would be concerned if such

                                groups were heavily weighted with
                                medical practitioners as one of the
                                comments suggested. Over reliance on

                                such practitioners1 to the exclusion of
                                scientists representing other relevant

                                scientifflc descriptives1 implies that the
                                herbs are to be used for medicinal

                                purposes. FLA stresses again that health
                                claims are about the relationship of

                                foods1 rather than drugs1 to a disease or
                                health-related condition.

                                2. Establishment of an Approach based
                                on a More Lenient or the Same Standard

                                FLA proposed to subdect dietary
                                supplements to the same scientifflc
                                standard and procedure that the statute

                                provides for foods in conventional food
                                form (section 403(r)(3)(b)(i) of the act).

                                The standard1 codiffled in y101.14(c)1
                                states:

                                (c) Validity requirement. FLA will
                                promulgate regulations authoriking a

                                health claim only when it determines1
                                based on the totality of publicly available

                                scientifflc evidence (including evidence
                                from well-designed studies conducted in a
                                manner which is consistent with

                                generally recogniked scientifflc procedures
                                and principles)1 that there is signifflcant

                                scientifflc agreement1 among experts
                                qualiffled by scientifflc training and

                                experience to evaluate such claims1 that
                                the claim is supported by such evidence.

                                FLA explained in the dietary supplement
                                health claims proposal (3W Fh 33100 at

                                33103) that it ynows of no standard and
                                procedure for dietary supplements that
                                would both be more lenient than the

                                standard and procedure for foods in
                                conventional food form and yet still have

                                the characteristics that FLA considers
                                necessary under the 1990 amendments

                                and their legislative history. The agency
                                stated that it had tentatively concluded

                                that a standard for health claims for
                                dietary supplements that is based only
                                on section 403(a)(l) of the act (21 U.S.C

                                343(a)(l))1 or that allows health claims





          based on the existence of substantial

          scientifflc evidence1 even though
          signifflcant scientifflc agreement about the
          validity of the claim does not exist1

          would be inconsistent with Congress:s
          desire to ensure that health claims that

          are made on food1 including dietary
          supplements1 are scientifflcally valid.

          FLA said that it was concerned that if it
          were to allow claims in the maryetplace

          whose validity had not been established1
          these claims would undercut the

          credibility of those health claims that are
          in fact valid. The agency said that if it

          were to allow such claims1 consumers
          would be left little better off1 and no less

          confused1 than they were in 19W91 before
          the passage of the 1990 amendments.
          FLA also expressed its tentative view

          that the proposed approach striyes the
          appropriate balance between the

          congressional concern for consumer
          fraud1 public health1 and sound science1

          on the one hand1 and the desire to
          provide the consumer with information

          on the other (3W Fh 33100 at 33100).

          4. A large number of comments asserted
          that FLA should establish an approach

          based on a more lenient standard for
          dietary supplements. Some of these

          comments argued that such an approach.
          ls directed by Congress and cited a

          statement of Senator Natch1 one of the
          primary authors of the 1990
          amendments1 that 44a more lenient

          standard for dietary supplementSs] is
          envisioned.:: One comment argued that

          by providing for the establishment of a
          separate standard for dietary

          supplements1 Congress had implicitly
          redected the rigid standard of 44signifflcant

          scientifflc agreement:: adopted for foods in
          conventional food form. The comment

          asserted that FLA was therefore bound
          by basic tenets of statutory construction

          to adopt a more lenient standard for
          dietary supplements1 as such an action

          would give meaning to Congress:s
          instructions1 whereas the adoption of the

          proposed standard would in effect render
          those instructions meaningless. The
          comment noted that courts have

          traditionally not interpreted provisions of
          a statute in ways that would render





                               other provisions superffluous.

                               A number of comments stated that using

                               the same standard and procedure for

                               dietary supplements as for foods in

                               conventional food form is counter to the

                               intent of the 1990 amendments because

                               Congress intended to maye more1 rather


                               than less1 information about the health

                               benefflts of dietary supplements available

                               to consumers. The comments asserted

                               that health information about the effects

                               of diet on disease is particularly

                               important to consumers of dietary

                               supplements in deciding which products

                               to buy.

                               Several comments argued that restricting

                               this information on dietary supplements


                               will deny millions of Americans the

                               information that they need to improve

                               their health and to help reduce their risy

                               of deadly aMictions such as heart disease

                               and cancer. The comments asserted that

                               such restriction will cost the nation

                               millions of dollars in health care

                               expenditures that could have been saved

                               through disease prevention.

                               Some comments expressed concern that

                               restricting the use of properly qualiffled


                               health claims based on preliminary

                               evidence would encourage

                               information-hungry consumers to seey

                               information about the health benefflts of

                               various dietary supplements from sources

                               such as booys and the media1 which may

                               be unreliable and which are not regulated

                               by FLA. These comments argued that
                                      .
                               adoptlng a policy that results in

                               consumers turning to information that

                               may well be misleading or outright false
                               .
                               ls contrary to the educational goals of

                               the 1990 amendments. One comment


                               stressed that FLA should assist

                               consumers by encouraging them to

                               reduce their risy of disease by changing

                               their diets1 lifestyle1 and other factors.

                               Comments suggested that FLA should

                               place more weight on the potential

                               benefflts of the health information than

                               on eliminating all possibility for

                               consumer misunderstanding or all

                               elements of risy associated with increased

                               consumption of dietary supplements. A


                               few of these comments advised that a

                               more lenient standard would be





          appropriate for dietary supplements
          because they are being sold to educated

          consumers rather than to the general
          population. Some of these comments

          disputed the argument that consumers
          could be misled by a more lenient

          standard. These comments noted that
          consumers continue to rely on health

          messages on products such as cigarettes
          and condoms1 despite the fact that the

          messages have changed over the years in
          response to new scientifflc fflndings. Other
          comments stated that studies have

          indicated that consumers are able to use
          various advertising claims about diet and

          disease in a rational and benefflcial
          manner.

          Several comments asserted that FLA
          should allow the use of preliminary

          health claims on dietary supplements and
          foods in conventional food form because
          .
          lt allows their use on drugs. The
          comments stated that FLA:s proposed

          revision of the44pediatric Use:: subsection
          of prescription drug labeling in the

          Federal hegister of October 101 1992 (31

          at worst.

          Nowever1 many comments argued against
          a more lenient standard and procedure

          for dietary supplements. Several
          comments stressed that the adoption of

          the proposed standard and procedure is
          supported by the legislative histories of
          the 1990 amendments and the LS act.

          One of these comments maintained that
          while the 1990 amendments give FLA
                                .
          the option of adoptlng a more lenient
          standard for dietary supplements1 the

          Congressional hecord denotes a madority
          opinion in favor of FLA applying the

          same standard to supplements that the
          act provides for conventional foods.

          A number of comments also warned FLA





                               that holding dietary supplements and

                               foods in conventional food form to

                               different standards for health claims

                               would lead to consumer confusion1 as the

                               health benefflts of nutrients derived from

                               dietary supplements would be allowed to

                               be characteriked as superior to the

                               benefflts of those same nutrients derived

                               from foods in conventional food form.


                               Some comments asserted that the

                               creation of public confusion would

                               directly undermine the intent of the 1990

                               amendments to clear up consumer

                               confusion about health claim information

                               and would 3.eopardike consumer

                               asserted that adoptlng a more lenient

                               standard for dietary supplements could

                               also allow some supplement

                               manufacturers to maye unsubstantiated


                               claims and undercut consumer belief in

                               the credibility of the entire supplement

                               industry. These comments asserted that
                                  .
                               a slngle universal standard would best

                               prevent consumer confusion by ensuring

                               that health claim information is uniform

                               on all foods.

                               Several comments supported the same

                               standard and procedure on the grounds


                               that it would ensure that health claims

                               appearing on the labels of dietary

                               peer-reviewed1 reproducible evidence. A

                               number of these comments stated that

                               because supplements1 unliye conventional

                               foods1 are tayen specifflcally for the

                               ls especially important that health claims

                               on these products be reliable because

                               more and more consumers are using

                               these products in the belief that the

                               products will protect their health. The


                               comments said that these consumers

                               were responding to the large amounts of

                               recent evidence indicating that vitamins1

                               minerals1 and other nutrients may play a

                               role in reducing the risy of chronic

                               diseases.

                               Some comments cautioned FLA that the

                               failure to ensure that health claims on


                               dietary supplements are reliable would

                               leave consumers open to fraud. A few of





          these comments pointed out that many

          consumers do not have the scientifflc

          ynowledge to 3.udge the veracity of label

          claims for themselves and presume that

          FLA regulations ensure that label claims

          are properly substantiated. One of these

          comments warned that older Americans

          are especially vulnerable to fraud. This

          comment pointed out that the elderly


          suffer disproportionally from diet-related

          diseases1 read supplement labels more

          often than other people1 are more

          trusting of salespersons1 and do less

          research than younger consumers. Other

          comments warned that unsubstantiated

          health claims can harm consumers by

          inducing them to consume products that

          are inherently unsafe1 to consume

          excessive doses of some substances1 or to

          forego more benefflcial forms of treatment

          for a given malady.


          A number of comments insisted that the

          proposed regulations will not restrict the

          fflow of information on nutrition and

          health to consumers. One of these

          comments stated that roughly W0 percent

          of supplement labels are already in

          compliance with the proposed

          regulations. Other comments noted that

          educational materials are not covered by

          the proposed regulations1 and that there

          are many available channels through


          which information can be freely

          disseminated other than food labeling.

          Moreover1 one comment contended that

          supplement labels are neither intended1

          nor currently used1 to educate the public

          but instead serve to sell the product to

          which they are attached.

          Some comments stated that applying the

          same standard to both conventional

          foods and dietary supplements would

          create a desirable 44level playing ffleld:: for


          all food processors and manufacturers.

          One comment stated the adoption of the

          proposed standard will provide an

          atmosphere in which all food

          manufacturers can move toward the

          production of healthier foods1 which will

          benefflt the public health.

          ln FLA:s reconsideration of how best to

          regulate dietary supplements1 one of the


          most signifflcant issues has been the issue

          of whether supplements should be





                               regulated under a more lenient standard
                               or the same scientifflc standard as that
                               established by Congress for food in

                               conventional food form. Lespite
                               assertions by some that Congress

                               directed that a more lenient standard be
                               established1 the legislative history of the

                               1990 amendments does not support such
                               a position. To the contrary1 as other
                               comments point out1 and as the agency

                               explained in the preambles of the health

                               Congress did not intend that the agency

                               be forced to adopt a different standard
                               for dietary supplements. lnstead1

                               Congress gave the agency the discretion
                               to adopt any appropriate scientifflc
                               standard and procedure for dietary

                               supplements. There was nothing in the
                               comments that indicated that FLA does

                               not have this discretion. lndeed1 as some
                               of the comments pointed out1 there was
                               considerable support in both the Nouse

                               of hepresentatives and the Senate for
                               adoption of the same scientifflc standard

                               and procedure for dietary supplements.
                               FLA addressed the position of members

                               of Congress on this issue in the preamble
                               of the dietary supplement health claims
                               proposal (3W Fh 33103):

                               Senator Natch left no question about his
                               position that FLA should use this

                               fflexibility Sto adopt the standard and
                               procedure for dietary supplements that

                               appears appropriate to the agency] to
                               adopt a more lenient standard t t t

                               Nowever1 other members of Congress
                               were equally clear about their position
                               that FLA should not adopt a more

                               lenient standard. ln the October 241
                               1990 Congressional hecord at S 1000W

                               Shef. 4]1 Senator Metkenbaum1 the other
                               primary author of the Senate
                               amendments1 stated:

                               t t t lt is my view that there is no
                               reason to do anything other than utilike

                               the same procedure and standard for
                               dietary supplements.

                               Whatever approach the Secretary tayes1
                               he must establish a system that evaluates





          the validity of health claims for dietary

          supplements. The system must be based
          on the same considerations that guide
          other agency decisions: public health1

          sound scientifflc principles and consumer
          fraud.

          Further1 the Nouse of hepresentatives
          clearly did not support a more lenient

          standard for dietary supplements. The
          statement of Nouse Floor Managers that

          appears in the October1 201 1990
          Congressional hecord at N 12933 Shef. 2]

          states:
          t t t Whatever approach the agency

          tayes1 it must adopt a system that
          evaluates the validity of any disease

          claims made with respect to these
          substances. lts system must be based on

          considerations of public health and
          consumer fraud. As in every similar

          decision made by the agency today1 we
          fully expect that the agency:s evaluation

          of disease claims made with respect to
          vitamins will be based on sound scientifflc

          principles.
          There is a great potential for defrauding

          consumers if food is sold that contains
          inaccurate or unsupportable health

          claims. The potential is dust as great for
          vitamins as it is for other products. ln

          our view1 vitamins and other substances
          covered by this provision should be

          subdect to at least as strong a standard
          as is applicable to other foods that
          contain claims that the food will treat a

          disease or health condition.

          Nothing in the LS act or its legislative
          history indicates in any way that
          Congress changed its position about its

          goals of the 1990 amendments with
          respect to prohibiting misleading health

          claims and improvement of the public
          health through use of valid and

          understandable claims in food labeling
           Shef. 3].

          Although Congress left no question that
          the exact standard and procedure for the

          regulation of health claims for dietary
          supplements is left to the discretion of

          FLA1 and although Congress did not
          provide direct guidance concerning how

          FLA should use this discretion1 Congress
          did provide considerable general guidance

          about the intent of the health claims





                               provisions of the 1990 amendments. ln
                               view of the fact that this guidance does

                               not distinguish between dietary
                               supplements and foods in conventional

                               food form1 FLA considers this guidance
                               to be applicable to both types of foods.
                               As pointed out above in this response1

                               Senator Metkenbaum1 the other primary
                               author of the Senate amendments1 stated

                               that whatever approach the Secretary
                               tayes1 he must establish a system that

                               evaluates the validity of health claims for
                               dietary supplements. Ne stressed that

                               the system must be based on the same
                               considerations that guide other agency
                               decisions: public health1 sound scientifflc

                               principles1 and consumer fraud (hef. 4).
                               The quoted statements of the Nouse

                               Floor Managers also stress that the
                               agency:s approach to regulating dietary

                               supplements must be based on
                               considerations of public health1 sound

                               scientifflc principles1 and consumer fraud
                               (hef. 2). ln addition1 these quoted
                               statements maye it clear that Congress

                               considered the use of 44inaccurate or
                               unsupportable health claims:: on food

                               labeling to be harmful to the public (hef.
                               2). Moreover1 Mr. Waxman1 one of the

                               Nouse Floor Managers stated the
                               following in the 'uly 301 1990

                               Congressional hecord (N3W44):
                               What we have sought to do is to permit

                               health claims but only health claims
                               based on scientifflcally valid information1
                               and we hope by having that scientifflcally

                               valid information upon which a claim can
                               be made1 that health claims in the future

                               will be healthful and not misleading.
                               Furthermore1 as the agency pointed out

                               in the 'anuary 01 1993 Federal hegister
                               (3W Fh 241W at 2320):

                               by enacting the 1990 amendments1
                               Congress sought to ensure that health

                               claims would be scientifflcally valid and
                               not misleading. (See1 for example1

                               statement of hep. Madigan1 and
                               statement of hep. Waxman1 Shef. 2]).

                               Experience had shown that many
                                44unfounded:: health claims were being
                               used on foods (statement of hep.

                               Waxman Shef. 2]). Congress recogniked
                               the 44great potential for defrauding

                               consumers if food is sold that contains





          inaccurate or unsupportable health
          claims.:: ld. (statement of Nouse ffloor

          managers).
          ln response to the high potential for

          health claims to be misleading1 Congress
          legislated that any claim that is not

          consistent with FLA regulations will
          misbrand a food. Section 403(r)(l)(b) of

          the act states that a food is misbranded
          if its label or labeling contains a claim
          that 44expressly or by implication t t t

          characterikes the relationship of any
          nutrient t t t of the food to a disease or

          a health-related condition unless the
          claim complies with regulations

          promulgated by FLA. y403(r)(l)(b)::
           (emphasis added). by taying this

          approach1 Congress chose to permit only
          those health claims on food that FLA

          determines to be scientifflcally valid1
          effectively recogniking that health claims

          are so potentially misleading as to be
          inherently misleading.

          Applying the same standard and
          procedure to health claims on dietary
          supplements as that that applies to foods
          .
          ln conventional food form will not affect
          the availability of any dietary

          supplements1 will ensure that health
          claims that appear in labeling are

          scientifflcally valid and understandable1
          and will subdect all segments of the food

          industry to regulation in a fair and
          consistent manner. Those comments

          favoring the same standard and
          procedure1 for reasons of fairness1 control
          of consumer fraud1 and conveyance of

          valid information about diet and its
          impact on a disease or health-related

          condition1 serve to reinforce FLA:s
          conclusion that the agency:s proposed

          rule should be fflnaliked as proposed.
          The agency disagrees with arguments

          that use of the same approach for dietary
          supplements as for conventional foods

          would deny millions of Americans the
          dietary information that they need to

          improve their health and thereby cost the
          nation millions of dollars in health care
          expenditures that could have been

          avoided. As FLA explained in the
          preamble of the dietary supplement

          health claims proposal (3W Fh 33100 at
          33103):





                                t t t ln the absence of adequate data to

                                establish that health claims are valid1
                                assertions about costs associated with

                                the lacy of information in food labeling
                                and about the benefflts of consumption of

                                substances in dietary supplements are
                                highly speculative and highly
                                questionable. FLA does not agree that it

                                should place more weight on the
                                potential benefflts of the health

                                information than on eliminating the
                                possibility of consumer

                                misunderstanding. FLA must weigh the
                                public health impact of permitting a

                                multitude of preliminary claims against
                                the possibility that a signifflcant portion

                                of those claims will be determined to be
                                not scientifflcally valid. The latter result

                                would liyely produce a perception among
                                many consumers that food labels and

                                health claims1 even those that are valid1
                                are not reliable. To the extent that1 as a

                                result1 consumers do not change their
                                dietary patterns to reduce their risy of

                                disease1 they will be less healthy1 and
                                there will be more needless deaths from

                                disease and more costs to the national
                                economy1 rather than less.

                                When FLA made this statement1 the

                                phrase 44adequate data to establish that
                                health claims are valid:: was intended to
                                express the position that until the

                                validity requirements of y101.14(c) are
                                met1 cost assertions about the benefflts of

                                substance consumption are highly
                                speculative and highly questionable. ln

                                general1 prior to fulfflllment of this
                                requirement1 there may often be studies

                                with a wide variety of strengths and
                                weaynesses indicating that there may1 or

                                may not1 be a valid association between a
                                substance and a disease or health-related

                                condition. ln deciding whether or not to
                                authorike a claim1 FLA must consider

                                that1 while benefflts may accrue from the
                                availability of the claim1 there is a very

                                real possibility that signifflcant costs may
                                accrue if the claim is authoriked

                                prematurely. A few studies may often be
                                found about a multitude of associations1

                                and many1 if not most1 of those
                                associations will ultimately be found not

                                to be valid. lf FLA were to permit
                                preliminary claims about such a





          multitude of associations1 the agency
          believes that ultimately what would be

          lost is the conffldence of most consumers
          in the validity of all claims that appear

          in food labeling. FLA believes that the
          costs to consumers of such a situation

          would prove to be greater than the costs
          of not permitting preliminary claims. Of

          greater signifflcance1 however1 is that
          needless deaths would ultimately occur

          where consumers would not change their
          dietary patterns to adopt a more

          healthful diet.
          The agency believes that Congress1 in its

          enactment of the scientifflc standard in
          section 403(r)(3)(b)(i) of the act1 strucy

          what it believed to be an appropriate
          balance between the costs and benefflts of

          claims on foods in general. FLA is not
          aware of any reason to striye a different
          balance for dietary supplements. FLA

          would liye to assure all affected parties
          that the agency will move as

          expeditiously as possible to permit
          health claims once the scientifflc evidence
          .
          ls suMciently supportive to conclude that
          associations between substances and

          disease or health-related conditions are
          valid.

          Although some comments asserted that
          claims based on a more lenient standard

          would not be confusing because
          consumers of dietary supplements are

          more ynowledgeable than the general
          population1 FLA pointed out in the

          preamble of the dietary supplement
          health claims proposal (3W Fh 33100 at

          33103) that there is nothing that limits
          the purchasers of dietary supplements to
           44ynowledgeable consumers.:: The

          comments did not submit dustifflcation for
          FLA to change its position in this regard.

          Assertions that use of the same scientifflc
          standard for dietary supplements as that

          established for food in conventional food
          form is counter to the 1990 amendments

          because less information about diet and
          disease will be available to consumers are

          not correct. Under the 1990
          amendments1 authoriked health claims

          provide considerably more information
          about the effects of diet on disease where

          the effects are recogniked as scientifflcally
          valid than was the case before the





                                passage of the 1990 amendments. ln the

                                Federal hegister of 'anuary 01 19931
                                FLA authoriked claims with respect to 1

                                relationships (see 3W Fh 23311 23321
                                20221 20031 21391 21W11 and 2W20). Also1
                                in the Federal hegister of October 141

                                1993 (3W Fh 33234)1 FLA proposed to
                                permit health claims concerning the
                                relationship between folate and the risy

                                of neural tube birth defects. Admittedly1
                                other health claims are not permitted to

                                appear on food labels and labeling1 but
                                Congress clearly intended through
                                enactment of section 403(r) of the act

                                that only valid health claims be
                                permitted.

                                With respect to concerns that consumers
                                will be forced to seey information about
                                diet and health from





          unregulated sources such as booys and

          the media1 if FLA does not authorike
          preliminary claims1 FLA advises that it

          must implement the provisions of the
          amendments as Congress chose to enact

          them. The 1990 amendments focus only
          on food labels and labeling. FLA cannot

          ignore its clear responsibilities under the
          1990 amendments because of concerns
          about the unregulated sources of

          information that were mentioned in the
          comments. Moreover1 while such sources

          of information may lead consumers to
          seey out products containing particular

          substances1 FLA:s action will ensure that
          the labels and labeling of those products

          contain only scientifflcally valid
          information that can dispel any

          misconceptions created by the
          unregulated sources. With respect to

          other concerns expressed by these
          comments1 the agency believes that the

          specifflc required elements in the health
          claims that it has authoriked to date
                                             .
          demonstrate that the agency ls
          encouraging consumers to reduce their

          risy of disease by changing their diets
          and lifestyle. For example1 the specifflc

          requirements in y101.12(c)(2)(A)
          requires1 in part1 that a claim about

          calcium and osteoporosis maye clear that
          an adequate level of exercise and a
          healthful diet are needed in addition to

          adequate calcium consumption.

          Arguments that the agency should allow
          preliminary claims because of FLA:s

          implementation of the drug provisions of
          the act have no merit. Assertions about

          FLA:s proposed action pertaining to     .
           44pediatric Use:: for drug labeling ln (31

          Fh 41423) are clearly wrong. The
          agency:s proposed action with respect to
          requiring the statement 44Safety and

          effectiveness in children have not been
          established:: pertains only to drugs for

          which there is no agency approval for any
          pediatric population to use the drug. ln

          point of fact1 the agency proposed to
          require this statement as a further

          warning that the product should not be
          used for pediatric populations. Thus1

          this action provides no support for
          authoriking preliminary health claims.

          As FLA pointed out in the preamble of





                               the dietary supplement health claims
                               proposal (3W Fh 33100 at 33100)1 maying

                               dietary supplements subdect to the same
                               scientifflc standard and procedure as for

                               conventional foods does not render
                               section 403(r)(3)(L) of the act

                               superffluous. This section requires that
                               the agency consider what procedure and
                               standard respecting the validity of claims

                               are most appropriate. This is what the
                               agency has done. The fact that the

                               agency has found that1 on balance1 the
                               standard and procedure established for

                               foods in conventional food form are also
                               the most appropriate for dietary

                               supplements does not render the agency:s
                               efforts invalid or the underlying provision
                               superffluous. The agency was charged

                               with exercising its expertise and
                               discretion1 and that is what it has done.

                               3. A number of comments provided
                                                                        .
                               specifflc suggestions about the way ln
                               which a more lenient approach could be
                               implemented. Some comments argued

                               that the approach should be suMciently
                               lenient to permit maryeting of dietary

                               supplements without any restrictions.
                               Some of these comments argued that

                               dietary supplements needed no stringent
                               requirements because dietary

                               supplements could be adequately
                               regulated under the requirement in
                               section 403(a)(l) of the act that the

                               labeling of a food must be truthful and
                               not misleading. Other comments

                               suggested that FLA could require a
                               warning informing the consumer that

                               FLA had not substantiated particular
                               claims appearing on a product. One

                               comment suggested that substantiated
                               claims could be allowed to appear within
                               a specifflc advisory panel of the label1

                               while preliminary claims would be
                               allowed to appear only outside the panel.

                               Another comment suggested that FLA
                               adopt a split label approach1 in which

                               preliminary health claims would be
                               allowed1 but the agency would have the

                               right to comment upon them on the
                               label.

                               One comment suggested that health
                               claims for which there is substantial

                               scientifflc evidence but not yet signifflcant
                               scientifflc agreement be subdect to a





          certifflcation and notifflcation procedure
          rather than rulemaying proceedings.

          Under the procedure suggested by the
          comment1 claims could be made for

          dietary supplements so long as: (l) The
          claim expressly discloses the absence of

          scientifflc agreement as to the
          relationship1 (2) the manufacturer

          provides FLA with a fully documented
          certifflcation by a panel of at least three

          qualiffled experts that there is substantial
          scientifflc evidence supporting the claim1

          and (3) FLA does not disapprove the
          claim within 90 days of receipt of the

          certifflcation. (When additional
          information is needed1 the 90 day period
          could be extended an additional 43 days.)

          Under this suggested alternative1 FLA
          would have an opportunlty to participate.

          in the selection of the expert panel.

          One comment requested that FLA only
          disallow the use of those health claims on

          dietary supplements that are not
          supported by any evidence1 and that it

          classify all other health claims into one of
          fflve categories and allow for their use on

          products in condunction with a code
          system indicating to consumers the level

          of substantiation that the claim has
          achieved. The comment suggested that
          the highest category be full

          substantiation; the second1 those claims
          that have a high degree of substantiation

          as dudged by non-FLA experts1 but that
          FLA fflnds to be not fully substantiated;

          the third1 claims that have support in the
          form of double-blind placebo controlled

          studies published in peer-reviewed
          professional dournals; the fourth1 claims

          that are supported by some evidence
          from in vitro studies1 animal studies1 or

          other studies that do not involve humans;
          and the fflfth1 those claims supported by

          anecdotal evidence. ln support of its call
          for various approval levels1 the comment
          stated that simply categoriking a claim

          as 44substantiated:: or 44unsubstantiated::
          does not accommodate the reality that

          full substantiation of a health claim
          consists of cumulative evidence from

          many studies. The comment maintained
          that if FLA were to place all claims that

          have not achieved full substantiation into
          the same category1 FLA would not be





                               providing a means for the public to

                               distinguish claims that are nearly

                               substantiated from those that are entirely

                               false. Moreover1 the comment stated that

                               an agency determination that a claim is

                               or is not supported by 44signifflcant

                               scientifflc agreement:: often refflects a

                               political decision rather than a scientifflc

                               one. The comments said that FLA


                               panels comprise a very small percentage

                               of the scientifflc community1 that other

                               scientists often disagree with the panels:

                               fflndings1 and that there even may be

                               differing opinions within the panels

                               themselves. The comment stated that1

                               given these conditions1 it is blatantly

                               dishonest and misleading to the public

                               for FLA to maye a general declaration

                               that a claim is or is not substantiated.


                               A few similar comments called for FLA

                               to devise a multilevel approval scheme

                               for health claims on dietary supplements

                               that would allow statements concerning

                               the traditional use of a product to

                               appear on the label and would permit

                               the label of a supplement that contained

                               a substance that was the sub3.ect of a

                               pending health claim petition to indicate

                               that the product was under FLA review

                               for a health claim but not to indicate the

                               nature of the claim. The comments

                               stated that the adoption of this approach


                               would encourage manufacturers of

                               products that qualify only for the

                               44traditional uses:: or 44claim pending::

                               approval categories to gather1 perform1

                               and submit research information to FLA
                               .
                               ln order to reach higher approval levels.

                               One comment suggested that FLA allow

                               manufacturers to use facsimiles of the

                               FLA seal in con3.unction with the various

                               ratings. The comment asserted that this


                               approach would encourage manufacturers

                               to come into compliance with FLA

                               regulations quicyly1 as the seals would

                               become valuable maryeting tools for

                               which consumers looy when purchasing

                               supplements1 and the lacy of a seal would

                               become a maryeting disadvantage for a

                               company.

                               FLA has considered these alternative

                               standards and procedures suggested by


                               the comments and fflnds that none of

                               them have the characteristics that are





          necessary to achieve the goal envisioned
          by Congress in passing the 1990

          amendments. previously in this preamble
          the agency concluded that Congress

          intended that FLA adopt a scientifflc
          standard and a procedure that ensure

          that health claims that appear in
          labeling are scientifflcally valid and

          understandable. None of the alternative
          standards and procedures offered by the

          comments meets this obdective. One of
          Congress: primary concerns in passing
          the 1990 amendments was the widespread

          use of health claims whose scientifflc
          validity had not been established (hef.

          1). The purpose of the 1990 amendments
          was to bring that situation under control.

          The problem with the alternative
          procedures offered by the comments is

          that1 rather than bringing the use of
          claims on dietary supplements under

          control1 they would ratify the state of
          affairs that caused Congress to act.

          As FLA explained in the preamble of the
          dietary supplement health claims

          proposal1 a standard for health claims for
          dietary supplements that is based only

          on section 403(a)(l) of the act1 or that
          allows health claims based on the

          traditional use of the supplement or the
          existence of substantial scientifflc evidence

          but not signifflcant scientifflc agreement
          about the validity of the claim1 would be
          inconsistent with Congress:s desire to

          ensure that health claims that are made
          on dietary supplements1 or on any other

          food1 are scientifflcally valid. FLA
          pointed out that if such claims were to

          be permitted1 consumers would be faced
          with a multitude of claims1 some valid

          and some not valid. FLA stated that it
          would be unliyely that consumers could

          distinguish between valid and invalid
          claims. Although comments on the

          dietary supplement health claims
          proposal asserted that consumers would
          not be confused by a multitude of claims1

          the comments did not actually go further
          ln addressing how consumers would react.

          to such a situation in food labeling.
          More specifflcally1 the comments did not

          provide data to resolve the question of
          whether consumers would be able to

          understand gradations of scientifflc





                               reliability of claims on food labeling1 or
                               whether consumers would1 in fact1 be left

                               as confused as they were before passage
                               of the 1990 amendments. While a

                               number of comments did assert that
                               some studies show that consumers are

                               able to use various advertising claims
                               about diet and disease in a rational and
                               benefflcial manner1 the studies were not

                               actually submitted. ln the absence of the
                               studies1 FLA has no basis upon which it

                               can evaluate the assertions of the
                               relevance of the studies to food labeling.

                               ln the absence of evidence to the
                               contrary1 the agency considers it more

                               liyely that consumers would be
                               considerably confused by a multitude of

                               claims with differing degrees of reliability.
                               One of the purposes of the 1990
                               amendments was to end such confusion

                               (see statement of Mr. Waxman1 130
                               Congressional hecord N12933 (hef. 2)).

                               Therefore1 FLA redects this assertion.
                               Approaches such as those involving a

                               44split label:: or the use of an FLA seal
                               would also not be consistent with the

                               congressional desire for scientifflc validity
                               because manufacturers would still be

                               able to maryet dietary supplements with
                               claims that were not scientifflcally valid.

                               Even if FLA seals were being used to
                               distinguish those claims that FLA
                               considered to be valid1 there would be a

                               question as to whether consumers would
                               be able to ascertain which claims were

                               preliminary and which were not. These
                               approaches would not restrict the number

                               of health claims that were of questionable
                               validity1 about which Congress was

                               specifflcally concerned (hef. 1).
                               Thus1 FLA has concluded that it would

                               not be appropriate to adopt any of the
                               alternative approaches suggested by the

                               comments.
                               0. Several comments suggested that FLA

                               adopt the reasonable substantiation
                               standard used by the Federal Trade

                               Commission (FTC) (see FTC policy
                               Statement hegarding Advertising
                               Substantiation program (49 Fh 309991

                               August 21 19W4)). The comments
                               asserted that under this policy1 FLA

                               could allow manufacturers to maye
                               claims provided that the nature of the





          scientifflc fflnding is accurately

          represented1 the degree of evidence is not
          misrepresented1 and the claim passes a
          rough cost)benefflt test. The comments

          argued that this policy would facilitate
          harmonikation with the FTC regulations

          governing the use of health claims in
          food advertising1 would allow consumers

          to have access to truthful1 nonmisleading1
          and reliable labeling information1 and

          would still allow FLA to taye action
          against those dietary supplements

          bearing health claims that are not
          properly substantiated.

          Arguments that FLA should adopt for
          dietary supplements FTC:s approach for

          regulating advertising are not consistent
          with Congress: expectations for health

          claims. While the FTC and FLA are
          worying together to achieve as much

          consistency in their approaches to health
          claims as their respective statutes allow1

          adoption by FLA of the FTC advertising
          substantiation approach would not

          provide FLA the conffldence Congress
          intended concerning the scientifflc validity

          of the claims. Specifflcally1 as explained.
          above1 one of Congress: maln purposes in

          passing the 1990 amendments was to
          ensure that health claims made in food

          labeling are scientifflcally valid. No such
          assurance of scientifflc validity is provided
          under the standard that FTC must

          employ. Under that standard1 there must
          be some evidence to support a claim1 but
          .
          lt need not rise to the level of establishing
          the claim:s validity. Thus1 the FTC

          standard is not adequate for health
          claims. ln this context1 it is appropriate

          to reiterate FLA:s response to comments
          asserting that it was bound to follow

          cases involving FTC:s regulation of
          advertising in the preamble of the health

          claims fflnal rule (3W Fh 241W at 232W):
          Although cases involving FTC may

          sometimes be relevant1 it is important to
          note that fundamental differences exist

          between the regulatory schemes
          administered by the two agencies.

          Congress has long recogniked the division
          of roles between the two agencies FTC

          concentrates on the interests of
          commerce and economic needs1 whereas

          the obdective of FLA is 44the health of





                                 the people.:: FTC regulates unfair
                                 competition and trade practices1

                                 including food advertising. (See1 for
                                 example1 13 U.S.C. sections 43 and 32.)

                                 ln contrast1 FLA is a scientifflc agency
                                 empowered to regulate the food label1

                                 among other things. Under section
                                 403(r)(3)(b)(i) of the act1 FLA may
                                 permit health claims on foods only if it

                                 has determined that those claims meet
                                 the statutory test for scientifflc validity.

                                 The laws under which FTC operates do
                                 not include a comparable statutory

                                 standard. Thus1 it would not be
                                 appropriate for FLA to follow the case

                                 law involving FTC.

                                 approach striyes the appropriate balance
                                 between the congressional concern for

                                 types of claims that would be subdect to

                                 the regulations promulgated under
                                 section 403(r)(l)(b) of the act. ln

                                 addition1 the agency proposed a
                                 defflnition for 44disqualifying nutrient

                                 levels:: to establish limits on the levels at
                                 which certain nutrients that are ynown

                                 to increase the risy of a disease or
                                 health-related condition could be present
                                 ln a food1 and the food would still be.

                                 eligible to bear a health claim (see
                                 section 403(r)(3)(A)(ii) of the act).

                                 ln the health claims fflnal rule1 the agency
                                 adopted defflnitions for the terms 44health

                                 claiml:: 44substancel:: 44nutritive valuel::
                                 and 44disqualifying nutrient levelsl:: that
                                 .
                                 lt revised in response either to comments
                                 or to the LS act (see y101.14(a)(l)1 (2)1





           (3)1 and (3)). Also1 FLA adopted a
          defflnition for the term 44disease or

          health-related condition.:: Although the
          term is used in the defflnition of 44health

          claiml:: and the term serves to identify
          one of the basic elements of a health

          claim1 the agency had not proposed a
          defflnition for it. The agency added this
          defflnition to clarify the coverage of the

          health claim provisions (see
           y101.14(a)(O)). because of the LS act1

          the agency reserved the question as to
          whether these defflnitions would apply to

          dietary supplements. The agency also
          did not include a defflnition of 44dietary

          supplement:: in the fflnal rule because of
          the moratorium imposed by the LS act.

          ln the dietary supplement health claims
          proposal1 FLA proposed to adopt the
          same regulatory scheme for health claims

          for dietary supplements that it had
          established for foods in conventional food

          form. To effect this tentative decision1
          the agency proposed to revise the

          defflnition of 44substance:: to maye clear
          that it covers both food in conventional

          food form and dietary supplements and
          to establish a defflnition for 44dietary
          supplement.::

          FLA received no comments on the
          former aspect of the proposal. Therefore1
                        .         .   .
          the agency ls adoptlng lt as proposed.
          Nowever1 FLA did receive some

          comments on its proposed defflnition of
           44dietary supplement.::

           1. Lietary Supplement
          FLA proposed the following defflnition

          for the term 44dietary supplement::
           (proposed y101.14(a)(4)):

          Lietary supplement means a food1 not in
          conventional food form1 that supplies a

          component to supplement the diet by
          increasing the total dietary intaye of that
          component.

          ln the past1 FLA has tayen a position
          that the term 44dietary supplement::

          applied only to supplements composed of
          essential nutrients. Nowever1 FLA did

          not propose to limit the defflnition in
           y101.14(a) in this way because section

          403(r)(3)(L) of the act includes dietary
          supplements of herbs1 substances that

          generally contain few essential nutrients.
          ln addition1 the legislative history





                                indicates that the term 44other nutritional
                                substances:: could include a number of

                                substances that have not been shown to
                                be essential or nutrients (hef. 4).

                                1. One comment commended the agency
                                for proposing a defflnition of 44dietary

                                supplement:: that recogniked that these
                                foods could have components other than

                                substances ynown to be essential
                                nutrients. The comment asserted that

                                the proposed defflnition would
                                appropriately move supplements out of

                                the food additive category.
                                FLA advises that the comment:s

                                assertion that the defflnition moves
                                dietary supplements out of the food
                                                     .
                                additive category ls not correct. A
                                dietary supplement1 as the defflnition
                                recognikes1 is a compounded food that

                                may include compounds that are food
                                additives. Whether a component of food
                                .

                                Congress specifflcally provided in section

                                9 of the 1990 amendments that these
                                amendments 44shall not be construed to

                                alter the authority of the Secretary of

                                supplements that are food additives are

                                still fully subdect to the food additive
                                requirements under section 409 of the

                                act.
                                W. A few comments requested that the

                                proposed defflnition of 44dietary
                                supplement:: be modiffled to explicitly

                                include all herbal extracts. One of these
                                comments asserted that the defflnition

                                should include 44processed or unprocessed
                                plant parts (bary1 leaves1 fflowers1 fruits1

                                and stems) as well as extracts of essential
                                oils1 maryeted as teas1 powders1 tablets1
                                capsules1 and elixirs.::
                                                .
                                FLA is adoptlng the defflnition of
                                44dietary supplement:: as proposed. This

                                defflnition is intentionally broad to cover
                                the range of substances that1 under the

                                legislative history1 could be included in a
                                dietary supplement and could be the

                                subdect of a health claim. The purpose of
                                the defflnition of 44dietary supplement:: is

                                not to defflne the substances that may be





          eligible to be the subdect of a health
          claim but to defflne the form in which

          they are to be sold to be subdect to
          regulation as a 44dietary supplement.::
                                                      .
          Under the scheme that FLA is adoptlng1
          and that Congress envisioned (see hef. 41

          statement of Senator Metkenbaum)1 the
          determination as to what substances are

          appropriately the subdect of a health
          claim is made on a case-by-case basis1

          based on the factors set out in y101.14(b)
          and the evidence presented to the
          agency. The agency disagrees with the

          comment in one respect1 however. Teas
          are food in conventional food form and

          thus not included within the defflnition of
          44dietary supplement.::

          9. One comment asserted the defflnition
          of 44dietary supplement:: should include

          foods in conventional food form that are
          fortiffled with a vitamin or mineral to a

          level of 30 percent or more of the
          heference Lally lntaye (hLl) per serving.

          (e.g.1 many breayfast cereals).
          FLA does not agree that such foods

          should be included in the defflnition of
          44dietary supplements.:: As discussed in

          the preamble to the dietary supplement
          proposal (3W Fh 33100 at 33101)1 FLA

          has limited this defflnition to foods not in
          conventional food form to refflect the

          approach tayen by Congress in the LS
          act. The manager:s statements for the

          LS act from the Senate and the Nouse
          (hef. 3) clearly state that the
          moratorium on the implementation of

          the 1990 amendments applies only to
          dietary supplements 44not in the form of

          conventional food.:: because foods in
          conventional food form were not covered

          by the LS act moratorium1 the health
          claims regulations already apply to them.

          Consequently1 FLA believes that it will
          reduce confusion about the impact of

          these regulations if the agency limits
          coverage of the term 44dietary
          supplements:: to foods not in

          conventional food form. Of course1 foods
          ln conventional food form that are.

          formulated to supplement the dietary
          intaye of nutrients will be free to refflect

          their characteristics in their common or
          usual name (e.g.1 vitamin and mineral

          supplement cereal).





                                 2. Nutritive Value

                                ln the health claims fflnal rule1 FLA
                                defflned 44nutritive value:: as follows:

                                Nutritive value means a value in
                                sustaining human existence by such

                                processes as promoting growth1 replacing
                                loss of essential nutrients1 or providing

                                energy.

                                Although FLA did not propose any
                                changes in the defflnition of 44nutritive
                                value:: in the dietary supplement health

                                claims proposal1 many comments
                                expressed concern about the impact of

                                this defflnition in condunction with the
                                preliminary requirement in

                                 y101.14(b)(3)(i) that the substance that
                                is the subdect of a health claim contribute

                                taste1 aroma1 or nutritive value1 or any
                                technical effect listed in y110(o)1 and

                                that the substance must retain that
                                 attribute when consumed at levels that

                                 are necessary to dustify a claim.
                                 (preliminary requirements are criteria in

                                 y101.14(b) that have to be met before a
                                substance will qualify to be the subdect

                                of a health claim. An indepth discussion
                                of all preliminary requirements follows in

                                section lll.b. of this document.)

                                 1O. Some comments urged the agency to
                                broaden its defflnition of 44nutritive
                                value.:: These comments urged the

                                 agency to recognike that the processes by
                                which a nutrient promotes health1

                                maintains proper bodily functioning1 and
                                protects the body from the development

                                of chronic disease or other health-related
                                conditions are1 in and of themselves1

                                characteristic of 44nutritive value.:: The
                                comments noted that the basic function

                                of Vitamin E1 for example1 relates to its
                                 antioxidant properties in preventing cell
                                                     .
                                damage by trapplng peroxyl free radicals
                                 and inhibiting the oxidation of

                                unsaturated fatty acids. Also1 the
                                comments pointed out that fflber does not

                                promote growth1 replace essential
                                nutrients1 or provide energy1 but that

                                 Congress specifflcally required FLA to
                                study the relationship between various

                                diseases and fflber. Some of the
                                comments asyed that the phrase

                                 44preventing or repairing the negative
                                metabolic consequences of life processes::

                                be added to the list of processes that





           characterike the nutritive value of a food

           to ensure that such components can be
           the subdect of health claims. A few

           comments asserted that FLA should
           revise the defflnition of 44nutritive value::

           to provide for claims about 44prevention::
           of a disease or health-related condition.

           Nowever1 one comment maintained that
           the defflnition of 44nutritive value:: in

           y101.14(a)(3) is broad enough to include
           the functions of most dietary

           supplements. The comment supported its
           position by agreeing with FLA:s

           statement in the health claims fflnal rule
           (3W Fh 241W at 24WW) that the inclusion

           of the phrase 44such as:: in the defflnition
           ensures that the three referenced

           processes are examples of how a
           substance may confer nutritive value

           rather than as an all-inclusive list.
           The comment that highlighted FLA:s

           use of the phrase 44such processes as:: in
           this defflnition is correct. FLA intended

           the three referenced processes to be
           examples of how a substance may confer

           nutritive value rather than as an
           all-inclusive list of the functions that

           provide such value. As FLA explained in
           the health claims fflnal rule (3W Fh 241W

           at 24WW)1 the defflnition of 44nutritive
           value:: is intended to be very fflexible.

           The agency incorporated this fflexibility
          in the defflnition because FLA recognikes

           that certain substances can play a mador
           role in reducing the risy of certain

           chronic diseases and may confer their
           benefflts through a number of processes.

           FLA believes that the agency should
           evaluate the nutritive value claimed for a

           substance that is proposed as the subdect
           of a health claim1 as described in a

           health claim petition1 on a case-by-case
           basis. This approach will best ensure

           that the defflnition retains its intended
          fflexibility and does not become an

           unintentional barrier to authorikation for
          legitimate health claims.

           FLA does believe1 however1 that this
           preamble should provide guidance

           concerning how the agency will determine
          if a claimed nutrient-disease relationship

           derives from the nutritive value of a
           substance. ln general1 the agency will

          looy for evidence that the claimed effect





                                on disease is associated with the normal

                                maintenance of human existence. lf the
                                substance is used to correct an abnormal
                                physiological function caused by a

                                disease or health-related condition1 the
                                action of the substance is clearly beyond

                                a normal maintenance function1 and the
                                health benefflt would therefore not derive

                                from the substance:s nutritive value.
                                Such a substance would be a drug. (Note

                                also that claims about classical nutrient
                                defflciency diseases are not health claims

                                (see 3W Fh 241W at 24Wl).)
                                FLA recognikes that many of the

                                benefflts mentioned in the comments may
                                derive from the nutritional value of a

                                substance. The agency:s broad defflnition
                                of 44nutritive value:: includes assisting ln  .

                                the eMcient functioning of classical
                                nutritional processes and of other

                                metabolic processes necessary for the
                                normal maintenance of human existence.

                                thereby providing nutritional value by

                                With respect to assertions that FLA

                                should revise the defflnition of 44nutritive
                                value:: to provide for claims about
                                44prevention:: of a disease or

                                health-related condition1 the agency
                                points out that the preamble of the

                                health claims fflnal rule (3W Fh 241W at
                                2301 through 2302) fully addressed this

                                matter and concluded that a claim that a
                                substance can be used in the prevention1

                                diagnosis1 cure1 mitigation1 or treatment
                                of a disease or symptom is inappropriate

                                for a food (see section 201(g)(l)(b) of
                                the act and y101.9(y)(l) (21 U.S.C.

                                101.9(y)(l))). FLA reached this
                                conclusion because the relationship of a

                                food or a food component to a disease is
                                quite different from that of a drug. The

                                comments maying these assertions did
                                not provide any basis upon which FLA
                                could conclude that the agency:s position
                                .
                                ln this matter should be different for
                                dietary supplements than for foods in

                                conventional food form. As FLA
                                explained in the preamble of the health





           claims fflnal rule1 the Surgeon Oeneral:s

           heport on Nutrition and Nealth (hef. 3)
           points out that1 apart from classic

           disorders resulting from dietary
           defflciencies of essential nutrients (e.g.1

           pellagra and niacin)1 it has proved
           diMcult to demonstrate causal

           associations between specifflc dietary
           factors and chronic or other diseases

           (e.g.1 dietary fflber and cancer). The
           report states:

           Levelopment of the mador chronic
           disease conditions      coronary heart
                                                        .
           disease1 stroye1 diabetes1 or cancer ls
           affected by multiple genetic1

           environmental1 and behavioral factors
           among which diet is only one          albeit an

           important component. These other
           factors interact with diet in ways that

           are not completely understood. ln
           addition1 foods themselves are complex;

           they may contain some factors that
           promote disease as well as others that are

           protective. The relationship of dietary
           fat intaye to causation of atherosclerotic

           heart disease is a prominent example. An
           excess intaye of total fat1 if characteriked

           by high saturated fat1 is associated with
           high blood cholesterol levels and

           therefore an increased risy for coronary
           heart disease in many populations. A

           higher proportion of mono- and
           polyunsaturated fats in relation to

           saturated fats is associated with lower
           blood cholesterol levels and1 therefore1

           with a reduced risy for coronary heart
           disease.

           because of these complexities1 defflnitive

           scientifflc proof that specifflc dietary
           factors are responsible for specifflc chronic

           disease conditions is diMcult        and may
           not be possible to obtain1 given

           available technology.
           (hef. 3).

           1l. Several comments argued that the
           defflnition of 44nutritive value:: should

           include levels of nutrients that are
           achievable only through the use of

           fortiffled foods or dietary supplements.
           Several of these comments referenced

           studies recently reported in the New
           England 'ournal of Medicine that

           indicate that vitamin E reduces the risy
           of heart disease when consumed at levels





                               that are almost impossible to achieve

                               through a conventional diet but that can

                               be easily and safely attained through the

                               use of dietary supplements. These

                               comments asserted that it would be

                               inappropriate for FLA to categorike the

                               involved nutrient levels of vitamin E as

                               therapeutic and to refuse to consider

                               approving a health claim simply because


                               the claim concerns levels of a nutrient

                               above that achievable in a normal daily

                               diet. A few of the comments supported

                               this assertion by noting that the

                               mechanism by which Vitamin E protects

                               against cell damage when consumed at

                               normal dietary levels is identical to the

                               mechanism by which it protects against

                               heart disease when consumed at higher

                               levels. The comments maintained that1
                               .
                               ln cases such as this one1 the agency

                               should approve health claims for use

                               strictly on dietary supplements1 provided


                               that the nutrient is safe when consumed

                               at the level at which the claimed effect is

                               achieved1 and the supplement is intended

                               to be consumed to optimike health rather

                               than as a drug. The comments supported

                               this regulatory approach by noting that

                               the health benefflts of calcium occur when

                               the nutrient is consumed at increased

                               levels that can be achieved through the

                               diet or by supplementation and stating

                               that vitamin E should not be treated

                               differently simply because the benefflcial

                               levels cannot be reached without the use

                               of dietary supplements.


                               Similar comments argued that FLA

                               should at least avoid establishing a

                               maximum level of a nutrient that is


                               considered to be characteristic of

                                44nutritive value.:: One of these comments

                               noted such an approach results in an

                               extremely fukky line1 because the

                               maximum level of a nutrient that is

                               achievable in a diet varies widely from

                               one individual to another. As an

                               example1 the comment pointed out that

                               a person who eats ten oranges or drinys a

                               quart of orange 3.uice per day gets more

                               vitamin C than is provided by most

                               currently maryeted vitamin C

                               supplements. A few comments asserted


                               that there is much scientifflc disagreement

                               over what levels of a nutrient are





           44nutritivel:: with many scientists

          contending that levels much higher than
          the U.S. hecommended Laily Allowances

           (U.S. hLA) fall within the defflnition. A
          few comments requested that FLA

          explicitly express in its regulations a
          policy that nutritive value may involve

          relatively high levels of a nutrient.

          A few comments maintained that FLA
          should presume that all nutrients

          function in a nutritive manner regardless
          of their level1 unless it has proof to the

          contrary. ln support of this position1 a
          number of comments obdected to the use

          of niacin:s effect on blood cholesterol
          levels in the dietary supplement proposal

           as an example of an effect that is not
          nutritive. One of these comments

          questioned FLA:s assertion that niacin
          does not exhibit cholesterol-reducing

          properties when ingested at the levels
          conventionally associated with its

          function as a vitamin. The comment
          stated that niacin:s vitamin effect occurs

          below the level of tissue saturation and
          maintained that the excretion of niacin

          when consumed at higher levels ynown to
          be associated with cholesterol-lowering

          effects does not necessarily indicate that
          tissue saturation has occurred. This

          comment also disagreed with the
           agency:s statement that the occurrence

          of liver damage when high levels of niacin
           are consumed indicates that the effect of

          niacin at these levels is not nutritive in
          nature. The comment argued that it is

          quite possible that niacin continues to
          have nutritive effects at these levels but
                   .
          simply ls overloading the body:s normal
          metabolic pathways for ridding itself of

          excessive levels of the nutrient. The
          comment asserted that while legitimate

          safety concerns exist in particular cases

          of excessive nutrient intaye1 FLA should
          not use this fact to conclude that high

          levels of those nutrients are inherently
          nonnutritive in nature and are instead

          pharmacological.
           Other comments expressed the belief

          that nothing in the proposed regulations
          would automatically exclude high levels

          of nutrients from the defflnition of
           44nutritive value:: and urged the agency

          to include such levels in instances where





                                they would benefflt the public health.

                                These comments also agreed with FLA:s
                                decision to review on a case-by-case basis

                                whether the amount of a substance is
                                appropriate as the subdect of a health

                                claim. One of these comments stated
                                that such an approach would help to

                                ensure that health information about
                                fortiffled foods and dietary supplements
                                can be conveyed without triggering the

                                drug regulations.

                                FLA does not believe that it is necessary
                                for the rules to explicitly state that

                                nutritive value includes relatively high
                                levels of a nutrient. As some comments

                                pointed out1 the case-by-case approach1
                                which1 as stated above1 is intrinsically
                                linyed with the preliminary requirement

                                in the provisions of

                                with considerable fflexibility with respect

                                to high levels of substances in dietary
                                supplements. Under this approach1 FLA

                                has not1 as a general rule1 established
                                any maximum level at which a nutrient
                                would cease to have 44nutritive value.::

                                Furthermore1 the agency advises that
                                there is no basis for concerns that FLA

                                would use safety concerns alone to
                                conclude that high levels of nutrients are

                                pharmacological. FLA will not do so.
                                As some of the comments pointed out1

                                petitions for claims that require that
                                high levels of substances be ingested

                                should have no problem demonstrating
                                that the substance has nutritive value

                                where the mechanism by which the
                                substance affects the risy of disease at

                                these high levels is the same as the
                                mechanism by which it functions as a

                                nutrient at normal dietary levels.
                                Nowever1 it will still be necessary1 as the

                                agency explained in response to the
                                previous comment1 for the petition to

                                show that the substance:s effect on
                                disease is associated with the normal

                                functioning of the human body (e.g.1 the
                                substance could not be used to correct an

                                abnormal physiological function caused
                                by a disease or health-related condition.)

                                ln its response to the previous comment1
                                the agency acynowledged that vitamin E

                                provides nutritive value through its
                                antioxidant function of reduction of cell





           damage. lf there are situations where it

           can be established that this same
           antioxidant mechanism affects the risy of

           disease when the vitamin is consumed at
           levels signifflcantly higher than normal

           dietary levels1 such levels would satisfy

           the requirement in y101.14(b)(3)(i) that
           a substance retain its food attribute (i.e.1
           its nutritive value) when consumed at

           levels that are necessary to dustify a

           claim.
           FLA does not agree1 however1 that it

           should presume that all nutrients
           function in a nutritive manner1 regardless

           of their level1 unless it has proof to the
           contrary. lt would not be practicable for

           the agency to bear the burden of
           determining the mechanism by which the

           claimed effect is occurring for each
           petitioned claim. Thus1 the agency fflnds

           that it is appropriate to require that
           petitioners provide the basis for why it is

           reasonable to conclude that the claimed
           effect is nutritional and not

           pharmacological. Nowever1 the agency
           does not necessarily expect absolute

           proof on this issue. FLA will evaluate
           petitions on this issue on a case-by-case

           basis.

           The agency has considered assertions
           that the dietary supplement proposal

           should not have cited the
           cholesterol-reducing properties of niacin

           as an example of a high dose effect that
           ls not nutritive. FLA has agaln.    .

           concluded that niacin is an appropriate
           example because there are signifflcant

           indications that a nutritive mechanism is
           not responsible for the

           cholesterol-lowering effect that occurs
           with high levels of niacin intaye. When

           FLA stated in the dietary supplement
           proposal that levels of niacin necessary

           to produce the cholesterol-lowering effect
           are far in excess of the levels at which

           there is tissue saturation for niacin:s

           vitamin function1 the agency was.
           attemptlng to explain that for niacin:s

           function as a vitamin there is a level
           beyond which additional niacin will not

           provide additional functional results for
           that vitamin. The term 44tissue

           saturation:: may imply either this type of
           situation (sometimes referred to as





                                 44function saturation::) or the type of

                                 situation referred to in one of the
                                 comments wherein the tissue is saturated

                                 with a concentration of a substance1 and

                                 more substance could immediately spill
                                 out into the urine. FLA was not
                                           .
                                 attemptlng to assert that the tissue itself
                                 was actually saturated. There is no

                                 question that additional niacin will be
                                 absorbed by cells when the vitamin

                                 function saturation level is reached.
                                 ln addition to the situation with vitamin

                                 function saturation1 there are other
                                 indications that the cholesterol-reducing

                                 properties of niacin do not result from
                                 the same mechanism as that presented by

                                 its vitamin function. Vitamin function
                                 saturation may be achieved through

                                 dietary supplementation with either of
                                 the two forms of the vitamin1 nicotinic

                                 acid or nicotinamide. Nowever1 only
                                 nicotinic acid provides1 at high levels1 the

                                 cholesterol-reducing effects. Such effects
                                 do not appear with high level

                                 consumption of nicotinamide (hef. 0). lf

                                 the same mechanism were involved with
                                 the vitamin function of niacin as with

                                 the cholesterol-reducing properties of
                                 niacin1 both forms of this vitamin should

                                 have cholesterol-reducing properties.
                                 3. Nealth Claim

                                 ln the dietary supplement health claim
                                 proposal1 FLA did not propose to maye

                                 any modifflcations in the defflnition of
                                 44health claim:: in y101.14(a)(l):

                                 Nealth claim means any claim made on

                                 the label or in labeling of a food1
                                 including a dietary supplement1 that

                                 expressly or by implication1 including
                                 44third party:: references1 written

                                 statements (e.g.1 a brand name including
                                 a term such as 44heart::)1 symbols (e.g.1 a

                                 heart symbol)1 or vignettes1 characterikes
                                 the relationship of any substance to a

                                 disease or health-related condition.
                                 lmplied health claims include those

                                 statements1 symbols1 vignettes1 or other
                                 forms of communication that suggest1

                                 within the context in which they are
                                 presented1 that a relationship exists

                                 between the presence or level of any
                                 substance in the food and a disease or

                                 health-related condition.
                                 Nonetheless1 FLA received several





           comments on this defflnition.

           12. Some comments asserted that FLA
           should clarify the types of statements

           that will be regulated as health claims.
           A few of these comments asyed whether
           statements that indicate that a product

           may be useful in maintaining good health
           (e.g.1 44Substance X may be benefflcial to

           good health::) or that describe the
           biochemical functions of vitamins1

           minerals1 and other nutrients (e.g.1
           44Vitamin A is necessary for good

           eyesightl:: 44protein helps build a strong
           body::) will be considered to be health

           claims. The comments obdected to FLA:s
          failure to provide clear instruction in this

           regard. These comments asserted that
           the agency:s allowance of case-by-case
          interpretation of the regulations will

           hinder industry compliance1 create
           enforcement problems for the agency1

           and cause continued antagonism between
           FLA and the food industry.

           FLA believes that it provided ample
           guidance on what types of statements

           constitute health claims in the health
           claims fflnal rule. As the agency

           explained in the preamble of that rule
           (3W Fh 241W at 2419 through 24WW)1 the

           defflnition establishes that a claim must
           have at least two basic elements for it to

           be regulated as a 44health claim.:: First1
           the claim must be about a 44substance::

           as defflned in y101.14(a)(2). Secondly1 the
           claim must characterike the relationship
           of that substance to a 44disease or

           health-related conditionl:: as defflned in
           y101.14(a)(O):

           Lisease or health-related condition
           means damage to an organ1 part1

           structure1 or system of the body such
           that it does not function properly (e.g.1

           cardiovascular disease)1 or a state of
           health leading to such dysfunctioning

           (e.g.1 hypertension); except that diseases
           resulting from essential nutrient

           defflciencies (e.g.1 scurvy1 pellagra) are
           not included in this defflnition (claims

           pertaining to such diseases are thereby
           not subdect to 101.14 or 101.10).

           lf a statement has one of these elements
           without the other1 it would not be a
           44health claiml:: although it may still be

           subdect to regulation under other





                                provisions of the act (e.g.1 the

                                requirement of section 403(a)(l) of the
                                act that a label statement be truthful
                                and not misleading). Thus1 all of the

                                statements mentioned by the comments
                                would not be health claims because they

                                do not address a disease or health-related
                                condition as defflned under y101.14(a)(O).

                                The agency has provided a lengthy and
                                detailed discussion on what types of

                                statements constitute health claims in
                                the health claims fflnal rule at the pages

                                cited above.
                                12. A few comments asyed whether FLA

                                would remove or prohibit the publishing
                                of booys containing information on

                                health claims and argued that such
                                regulations would clearly be

                                unconstitutional. Other comments
                                addressed the issue of whether FLA:s
                                health claims regulations for dietary

                                supplements would apply to advertising.
                                One of these comments interpreted an

                                excerpt from the report of FLA:s Tasy
                                Force on Lietary Supplements as an

                                attempt to disallow the use of
                                unapproved health claims in magakines1

                                newsletters1 or other media channels
                                unless the information has been

                                preapproved by FLA. That excerpt
                                reads:

                                The tasy force considered various issues
                                in its deliberations1 including how to

                                assure the safety of dietary supplements;
                                how to limit the potential for fraud1 i.e.1

                                disease claims made on labels or through
                                other means1 e.g.1 magakine articles1
                                newsletters1 and advertisements t t t       .

                                The comment further asserted that this

                                same intent is refflected in the health
                                claim regulations proposed in November
                                1991. The comment stated that this

                                broad-based application of the health
                                claims regulations would severely

                               deopardike the reporting of health and
                                disease-related information in almost

                                every form of media1 would inhibit the
                                evolution of scientifflc ynowledge1 would

                                have a signifflcant negative impact on the
                                public health of America1 and was liyely

                                unconstitutional.
                                FLA advises that the provisions of this

                                regulation pertain only to a product:s
                                label and labeling. This regulation does





           nothing to censor the content of booys1
           magakines1 or advertising. This

           regulation also does not in any way
           regulate the availability of booys1
           magakines1 or advertising. Nowever1 fflrms

           sometimes choose to use such material as
           labeling for their products1 and if used as

           such1 the material would be subdect to
           this regulation. For example1 sometimes

           fflrms copy an article from a magakine
           and display that article with a product

           that is offered for sale. Under such
           circumstances1 the article would be a
           part of the labeling of that product.

           What is signifflcant to note is that these
           regulations in no way limit what articles

           may be published1 or what booys may be
           printed. They limit only the claims that

           may be made in the labeling of food
           products. Under the act1 advertising may
           provide obdective evidence of what the

           intended use of a particular product is. lf
           the advertising reveals that the product

           is intended to be used as a drug1 the
           product may be regulated as a drug. ln

           addition1 claims made in advertising may
           affect the type of nutrition labeling that
           ls provided (see y101.9(d)). Claims made.
           .
           ln advertising1 however1 are not subdect
           to section 403(r)(l)(b) of the act.

           Thus1 the agency fflnds no merit in the
           concerns expressed by these comments.

           b. preliminary hequirements for a Claim
           ln the health claims fflnal rule1 FLA

           established several criteria in y101.14(b)
           that have to be met before a substance

           will qualify to be the subdect of a health
           claim. The criteria provide that the

           substance must: (l) be associated with a
           disease or health-related condition for
           which the general U.S. population is at

           risy (alternatively1 the relevance of the
           claim may be explained within the

           context of the daily diet) (see
           y101.14(b)(l)); (2) be a food (see

           y101.14(b)(2) and (b)(3)(i)); and (3) be
           safe and lawful under applicable food

           safety provisions of the act (see
           y101.14(b)(3)(ii)). These criteria refflect

           not only the requirements of section
           403(r) of the act but also the fact that
           FLA is charged with ensuring that the
                          .
           food supply ls safe1 and that the food
           label is not misleading. Oiven that





                                agency evaluations of the validity of a
                                health claim will be resource intensive1

                                FLA decided not to undertaye such
                                evaluations unless a petition for a health

                                claim demonstrates that the preliminary
                                requirements are met. While FLA had
                                proposed in November of 1991 that these

                                preliminary requirements cover
                                substances in dietary supplements as well

                                as foods in conventional food form1 the
                                provisions of the LS act precluded the

                                agency from applying these preliminary
                                requirements to substances in dietary

                                supplements at the time that the rule
                                was fflnaliked. Thus1 the preliminary
                                requirements established in the health

                                claims fflnal rule apply only to substances
                                in foods in conventional food form.

                                The dietary supplement health claim
                                proposal contained provisions to subdect

                                the components of dietary supplements
                                to the same preliminary requirements in

                                y101.14(b) that apply to any other
                                substance that is proposed as the subdect

                                of a health claim. This fflnal rule for
                                dietary supplements retains these
                                provisions as proposed. Specifflc reference

                                to dietary supplements in y101.14(b)(l)
                                and (b)(2) is not necessary because the

                                requirements in these paragraphs apply
                                generally to any 44substancel:: and FLA:s

                                revision of the defflnition of 44substance::.
                                ln y101.14(a)(2) includes the components

                                of dietary supplements within the
                                coverage of this term. Nowever1 FLA
                                proposed to add a specifflc reference to

                                dietary supplements to paragraph
                                (b)(3)(i) of y101.14 to clarify that the

                                substance may be a component of a food
                                that is in the form of a dietary

                                supplement. The only comments on the
                                issue agreed with the agency:s proposed

                                revision. Accordingly1 as proposed1 FLA
                                is including in the fflnal regulations a
                                reference to dietary supplements in the

                                codiffled language of y101.14(b)(3)(i).
                                Specifflcally1 FLA is inserting the phrase

                                44regardless of whether the food is in
                                conventional food form or dietary

                                supplement form:: into y101.14(b)(3)(i).
                                1. Effect on Oeneral population

                                13. One comment argued that the
                                proposed requirement that a substance

                                be associated with a disease or





          health-related condition for which the

          general U.S. population or a
          subpopulation thereof is at risy1 or that

          the claim be explained within the
          context of the daily diet1 would prohibit

          the appearance of health claims on
          herbal dietary supplements. Nowever1

          the comment did not explain how the
          requirement would have this effect1 and
          the comment:s own analysls of how garlic.

          would or would not meet various
          proposed requirements indicated that

          garlic would meet this particular
          requirement.

          FLA does not agree that this preliminary

          requirement will present any signifflcant
          barriers to the appearance of health
          claims on dietary supplements. To the

          contrary1 as the agency explained in the
          preamble of the health claims fflnal rule

           (3W Fh 241W at 2499)1 FLA intends to
          employ a fflexible approach in

          interpreting this provision. The
           alternative aspect of the provision1 which

          creates the possibility of claims about the
          relationship of a substance to a disease or

          health related-condition that affects very
          few in the U.S. population as long as the

          petition in support of the claim addresses
          that fact and the relevance of the claim

          in the context of the total daily diet1
          evidences a determination by FLA to

          provide the widest latitude possible for
          proposed claims to qualify under this

          provision.
           14. One comment requested that FLA

          not limit the diseases or health-related
          conditions that may be the subdect of a

          health claim to those for which the entire
          United States is at potential risy. The

          comment asserted that health claims
          should also be allowed in cases where

          dietary factors have been conclusively
          shown to affect diseases or health-related

          conditions for which only a particular
          subportion of the U.S. population is at

          risy (e.g.1 ovarian cancer in women).
          FLA advises that the general eligibility

          provisions of its health claims regulations
          ln y101.14(b)(l) do not contain the.

          restriction cited by the comment. While
          these provisions contain a requirement

          that health claims pertain to diseases or
          health-related conditions affecting the





                                general U.S. population1 they also
                                provide that health claims may pertain

                                to diseases or health-related conditions
                                for which an identiffled subgroup of the

                                U.S. population is at risy. Thus1 ovarian
                                cancer in women would clearly be an

                                appropriate subdect of a health claim.
                                2. Components of Food Within the

                                Context of a Laily Liet
                                The preliminary requirement that a

                                substance that is to be the subdect of a
                                health claim must be a food appears in

                                y101.14(b)(2) and (b)(3)(i). lf the
                                substance is present at decreased dietary
                                levels1 under y101.14(b)(2)1 it must be a

                                nutrient that is required to be included in
                                nutrition labeling (e.g.1 cholesterol1 total

                                fat). lf the substance is present at other
                                than decreased dietary levels1 under

                                y101.14(b)(3)(i)1 it: (l) Must contribute
                                taste1 aroma1 or nutritive value1 or any

                                other technical effect listed in y110.3(o)1
                                to the food and (2) must retain that
                                attribute when consumed at levels that

                                are necessary to dustify a claim.

                                13. Numerous comments expressed
                                concern about the aspect of the
                                preliminary requirement of

                                y101.14(b)(3)(i) that requires that a
                                substance contribute taste1 aroma1 or

                                nutritive value1 or any technical effect
                                listed in y110.3(o)1 in view of the

                                agency:s defflnition of 44nutritive value:: in
                                y101.14(a)(3). A number of these

                                comments characteriked these provisions
                                as an attacy by the agency against
                                dietary supplements. Some comments

                                asserted that the proposed preliminary
                                requirement would prohibit dietary

                                supplements1 especially those containing
                                herbs1 from bearing health claims.

                                Comments pointed out that many herbs1
                                such as garlic1 are specially processed to

                                remove the fflavor or odor from the fflnal
                                supplement product. A number of
                                comments explained that such

                                supplements would fail to meet this
                                requirement because their benefflcial

                                effects on the body often are derived
                                from substances unique to the plant that

                                do not promote growth1 replace loss of
                                essential nutrients1 or provide energy. A

                                few comments also noted that many
                                herbs contain insignifflcant amounts of





          vitamins1 minerals1 and other nutrients.
          Some comments asserted that the

          adoption of any preliminary requirement
          that would automatically disqualify

          herbal dietary supplements from bearing
          health claims would undermine the intent

          of Congress to establish a nondrug review
          process for health claims involving herbs.

          These comments asserted that the 1990
          amendments clearly provide that herbal
          dietary supplements can be the topic of a

          health claim. Furthermore1 a comment
          asserted that the Court of Appeals held
          .
          ln Nutrilab1 lnc. v. Schweiyer 1 113 F.2d
          3331 33W (1th Cir. 19W3) that some

          products1 such as prune duice or coffee1
          may be consumed for reasons other than
          taste1 aroma1 or nutritive value.

          One comment asserted that all dietary
          supplements already meet the this

          preliminary requirement. The comment
          noted that a substance to be consumed

          at other than decreased dietary levels
          may also be shown to be a food by

          contributing any technical effect listed in
          y110.3(o). The comment stated that

          y110.3(o)(20) lists one of those technical
          effects as nutrient supplementation and
          broadly defflnes a 44nutrient supplement::

          as 44substances which are necessary for
          the body:s nutritional and metabolic

          processes.::
          FLA does not believe that it is overly

          restrictive to require1 as it does in
          y101.14(b)(3)(i)1 that a substance be a

          food or a component of food for it to be
          the subdect of a health claim. Section

          403 of the act1 which includes the health
          claims provisions1 states1 44A food shall
          be deemed to be misbranded t t t::

          (emphasis added). Thus1 section 403(r)
          of the act describes the circumstances in

          which a food will1 and will not be1
          misbranded if it bears a health claim. lt

          is therefore appropriate for the agency to
          maye it incumbent on the proponent of a

          health claim to demonstrate that the
          substance that is to be the subdect of the
          claim is a food or component of food.

          FLA disagrees with the comments:
          interpretation of the Nutrilab decision.

          As FLA explained in the preamble of the
          health claims fflnal rule (3W Fh 241W at

          2499-2300)1 the Nutrilab court adopted a





                                 44common sense:: defflnition of 44food::
                                 under section 201(f)(l) of the act:

                                 44When the statute defflnes 4food: as
                                 4articles used for foodl: it means that the

                                 statutory defflnition of 4food: includes
                                 articles used by people in the ordinary

                                 might sometimes also be consumed for an

                                 ln y101.14(b)(3)(i)1 FLA incorporated
                                 this common sense defflnition of food and

                                 the phrase 44or any technical effect listed.

                                 201(f)(3) of the act includes 44articles
                                 used for components of foodl:: as a

                                 preliminary requirement to ensure that a
                                 substance that is to be the subdect of a

                                 health claim is in fact a food. This
                                 preliminary requirement is fundamental

                                 because both the component of a food
                                 that is the subdect of a health claim and

                                 a component of a drug have a
                                 characterikable relationship to a disease.

                                 Congress recogniked this fact by creating
                                 an exception from section 201(g)(l)(b) of
                                 the act1 in the defflnition of 44drug:: for

                                 foods that bear a claim authoriked under
                                 section 403(r) of the act. Thus1 it is

                                 crucial to the continuing viability of the
                                 act itself that the choice of the test that

                                 determines whether a claim that
                                 characterikes the relationship of a

                                 substance to a disease can be made be





           based on the appropriate factors. Under
           the act1 that choice turns in part on

           whether the substance is a food.
           Therefore1 FLA has refflected in

           y101.14(b)(3)(i) the dudicially recogniked
           characteristics of a food.

           ln this regard1 interested persons should
           not presume that inclusion of the phrase

           44or any technical effect listed in
           y110.3(o):: in y101.14(b)(3)(i) means that

           substances that may be classiffled within
           one or more of the categories of food

           additives in y110.3(o) automatically meet
           this preliminary requirement. The
           classifflcations within y110.3(o) are of a

           general nature to refflect the uses to
           which food ingredients are put. All of the

           classifflcations pertain to the effect of the
          lngredients on food (e.g.1 by affecting the.

           texture of the food) rather than on the
           human body. Only a substance that is

           used for the technical effect in
           y110.3(o)(20)1 that of a nutrient

           supplement1 has the potential to have a
           useful effect in the body because of the
           characteristics that cause it to be used in

           the food. The 44nutrient supplement::
           category includes 44Substances which are

           necessary for the body:s nutritional and
           metabolic processes.:: As the comments

           themselves recogniked1 not every
           component of a dietary supplement has

           such an effect.
           ln view of the agency:s broad1 fflexible

           defflnition of 44nutritive valuel:: FLA does
           not fflnd any merit in arguments that the
           provisions requiring that a substance be a

          food should be removed. To the contrary1
           FLA believes that these provisions will

           benefflt the public health by allowing the
           agency to devote its limited resources for

           review of petitions to those that are
           appropriate for consideration under the

           health claim provisions of the act.
           Accordingly1 FLA considers these

           provisions essential elements under the
          framewory that it has created in its
           regulations for the regulation of health

           claims and fully consistent with the act.
           FLA disagrees with the comments:

           characterikation of its actions as an
           attacy against dietary supplements. FLA

           believes that the combined effect of
           y101.14(b)(3)(i)1 the preliminary





                                requirement that a substance be a food1

                                and y101.14(a)(3)1 the defflnition of
                                44nutritive valuel:: will not present dietary
                                supplements with any unreasonable

                                barriers for agency evaluation of
                                potential health claims for components of

                                these products. Without question1 these
                                provisions do restrict health claims to

                                effects on a disease or a health-related
                                condition resulting from the nutritive

                                value of substances. Nowever1 as one
                                comment pointed out1 the current

                                defflnition of 44nutritive value:: in
                                y101.14(a)(3) is broad enough to include

                                the functions of most dietary
                                supplements.

                                One observation that might bear maying
                                in this context is that Congress has given

                                the agency a statutory structure with
                                which to deal. ln relevant part1 that

                                structure divides the world of substances
                                that have a relationship to disease into

                                foods and drugs. Congress placed the
                                health claims provisions on the food side
                                of the ledger. FLA is charged with

                                implementing those provisions in
                                accordance with the act and applicable

                                legal precedents. FLA has announced its
                                intention to implement the health claim

                                provisions as fflexibly as possible1 but at
                                some point the agency simply cannot be

                                as fflexible as some of the comments have
                                suggested. At that point1 the agency

                                would start to erode the scheme that the
                                statute has established for drugs. The

                                agency cannot do that. lf Congress
                                intended something that goes beyond the
                                scheme that FLA has established in

                                these fflnal regulations1 then what is
                                required is a change in the law itself.

                                1O. Many comments obdected to the

                                aspect of y101.14(b)(3)(i) that requires
                                that a substance retain its food status

                                (i.e.1 its nutritive value) when consumed
                                at levels that are necessary to dustify a
                                claim. Almost all concern was directed

                                toward consumption of substances at
                                levels signifflcantly higher than those

                                present in the daily diet. Some comments
                                urged FLA to evaluate proposed health

                                claims involving relatively high levels of
                                nutrients on the grounds that

                                categorically prohibiting them would
                                deny Americans benefflcial information





          rather than educating them on how to

          alter their diets to achieve optimal
          health. Other comments stated that
          FLA:s categorical refusal to evaluate

          such health claims because of the
          nutrient levels involved would directly

          violate both the proxmire Amendment
          and the congressional intent behind the

          1990 amendments. These comments
          noted that the 1990 amendments provide

          for the appearance of health claims on
          foods and stated that1 subdect to certain

          conditions1 the proxmire Amendment:s
          prohibition against regulating a vitamin

          supplement as a drug 44solely because it
          exceeds the level of potency which the
          Secretary determines is nutritionally

          rational or useful:: guarantees the
          regulation of vitamins as foods regardless

          of the levels of nutrients that they
          supply. The comments also stated that

          Congress envisioned the approval of such
          health claims1 as it was aware that

          dietary supplements substantially in
          excess of the U.S. hLA:s were routinely

          being consumed by Americans1 and it
          chose to direct that FLA conduct a

          review of antioxidant vitamins)cancer
          claims with dietary supplements in mind.

          Other comments further asserted that.
          FLA was attemptlng to circumvent the
          proxmire Amendment and create

          maximum potency levels for all
          supplements by establishing an upper

          limit for 44nutritive value.::

          FLA does not agree that any confflict
          with section 411 of the act is presented

          by a requirement that1 to be the subdect
          of a health claim1 the substance must be
          a food1 that is1 consumed primarily for

          its taste1 aroma1 or nutritive value.
          There is nothing in the health claims

          fflnal rule or in the regulations established
          by this document that will affect in any

          way the availability of dietary
          supplements or consumers: freedom to

          choose to purchase them. hather1 the
          regulations that FLA is establishing are

          intended to ensure that any health claims
          that may be made for dietary

          supplements are scientifflcally valid. This.
          ls what section 403(r)(3)(L) of the act

          directs FLA to do.
          Nothing in these regulations would





                                necessarily prevent a supplement from
                                bearing a health claim when it contains a

                                level of a substance that exceeds the level
                                achievable in the context of the daily

                                diet. To the contrary1 the fflnal rule
                                concerning calcium and osteoporosis1 for

                                example1 which was published in the
                                Federal hegister of 'anuary 01 1993 (3W

                                Fh 2003)1 permits a calcium health claim
                                for dietary supplements and requires only

                                that the supplement labeling advise
                                consumers1 in appropriate circumstances1

                                that there is no ynown benefflt from
                                consuming more than 200 percent of the
                                recommended daily intaye for calcium.

                                Section 411 of the act does not authorike

                                health claims for dietary supplements or.
                                ln any way affect FLA:s authority under

                                section 403(r)(3)(L) of the act to
                                regulate such claims. Under section

                                411(a)(l)(b) of the act1 FLA may not
                                classify a dietary supplement as a drug
                                solely because it contains a vitamin or

                                mineral at a level that exceeds the level
                                of potency that the agency determines is

                                nutritionally rational or useful. Nothing
                                in these proposed regulations would do

                                so. Absent a claim1 FLA will not
                                consider a dietary supplement to be a

                                drug because it contains vitamins or
                                minerals at levels above those normally

                                found in food. Nowever1 a claim on a
                                product is an indication of the product:s
                                intended use. lf a claim reveals that the

                                product is intended for a use other than
                                for its taste1 aroma1 or nutritive value1
                                                .
                                then nothing ln section 411 of the act
                                would require that it be treated as a

                                food.
                                1l. Many comments addressed the

                                circumstances under which dietary
                                supplements should be considered drugs.

                                A number of these comments referred to
                                the followlng agency statement in the.

                                health claims fflnal rule (comment 491 3W
                                Fh 241W at 2301):

                                A product that is intended for medicinal
                                effects1 that is1 intended for use in the

                                diagnosis1 cure1 mitigation1 treatment1 or
                                prevention of disease1 is a drug and not a

                                food. Thus1 there is no basis under the
                                act for FLA to permit health claims for

                                herbs whose only ynown use is for
                                medicinal effects. Nealth benefflts of such





          herbs may appear in the labeling only in
          accordance with the drug provisions of

          the act.
          Although a few comments agreed with

          this statement1 many comments
          expressed categorical opposition to the

          classifflcation of any herbs or other
          dietary supplements as drugs. While

          most of these comments did not offer
          reasons in support of their position1 one

          comment expressed concern that such a
          policy would be grounds for FLA to

          categorically ban all such supplements as
          unapproved new drugs. Several
          comments noted that many herbs have

          traditionally been used both as foods and
          drugs and asyed for assurance that FLA

          would not automatically regulate such
          herbs as drugs. Other comments argued

          that herbs should always be regulated as
          foods where they are consumed for their

          nutritive value.
          Some comments stressed that intended

          use1 as stated on its labeling1 should be
          the determinative factor in deciding

          whether a supplement should be
          regulated as a food or as a drug. As an

          example1 one of these comments stated
          that a supplement maryeted for a specifflc
          therapeutic use (e.g.1 a vitamin C tablet

          sold to cure cancer) is appropriately
          regarded as a drug1 while a supplement

          sold to be tayen over a period of time to
          reduce the risy of developing a disease

          (e.g.1 a vitamin C tablet sold to be tayen
          daily to reduce the risy of cancer) should

          be regulated as a food. The comment
          asserted that this approach is consistent

          with FLA:s determination that a
          supplement containing large amounts of
          niacin should be regulated as a drug

          when consumed to lower serum
          cholesterol. Another of these comments

          emphasiked that a consumer:s use of a
          legally labeled product should not have

          any weight in determining whether that
          product is a drug. As an example1 the

          comment noted that FLA does not
          regulate either fflber or water as a drug as

          long as their labeling does not bear drug
          claims1 even though consumers may use
          them to facilitate bowel movement or to

          prevent1 mitigate1 or treat

          dehydration1 respectively.





                                A few comments suggested that FLA

                                determine whether a substance is a food

                                or a drug by its chemical composition.

                                The comments asserted that while the

                                boundary between drugs and

                                supplements is fukky at times1 drugs are

                                typically synthetic molecules that are of

                                a unique and patentable nature1 while

                                dietary supplements consist of natural1


                                nonpatentable materials.

                                Another comment stated that FLA

                                should exempt substances tayen to treat

                                a symptom of a disease from regulation

                                as drugs1 as the act defflnes as drugs only

                                those substances used in the diagnosis1

                                cure1 mitigation1 treatment1 or

                                prevention of the disease itself.


                                Earlier in this preamble1 FLA explained

                                that these regulations do not affect the

                                availability of dietary supplements.
                                    .
                                Agaln1 these regulations affect only the

                               food label and food labeling. FLA has

                                no intention of banning all dietary

                                supplements of herbs or similar

                                substances as unapproved new drugs.

                                FLA will carry out its responsibility to

                                regulate inappropriate claims1 but the

                                agency will not attempt to restrict the

                                sale of dietary supplements to consumers


                                unless the supplements present safety

                                concerns.

                                With respect to the specifflc words for use

                               in labeling statements1 FLA advises that

                                statements that a product may be

                                effective in the cure1 mitigation1

                                treatment1 or prevention of disease will

                                maye the product a drug. Nowever1

                                statements that a product may reduce

                                the risy of developing a disease or


                                health-related condition may1 or may

                                not1 maye the product a drug. Exactly

                                how a substance-disease relationship is to

                                be characteriked is one of the issues that

                                the agency will address in deciding

                                whether to authorike a health claim and

                                how to ensure that the claim describes

                                the signifflcance of the substance in

                                affecting the disease or health-related

                                condition. FLA points out that as a

                                general matter1 merely using terms such

                                as 44reduce the risy:: instead of 44prevent::

                                will not automatically maye a claim a


                                health claim and not a drug claim. FLA

                                will maye a case-by-case assessment





          based on all relevant factors in
          determining whether a claim is

          appropriately subdect to the health
          claims regime. The agency also agrees

          that the main focus in deciding whether
          a product is subdect to regulation as a

          food or a drug is the intent of the vendor
          and not how consumers use the product

          (although how consumers understand
          claims that are made can be used to
          determine vendor intent).

          FLA advises that there is no provision in

          the act for the agency to exempt
          statements about symptoms of disease
          from causing products to be regulated as

          drugs. Although such statements may
          not be claims that the product will treat

          the disease that causes the symptoms1
          the statements clearly pertain to the

          mitigation of disease by addressing the
          symptoms caused by the disease. Section

          201(g)(l)(b) of the act provides1 in part1
          that articles intended for use in the

          mitigation of disease are drugs. Similarly1
          there is no provision in the act for FLA
          to exempt natural1 nonpatentable
                                                         .
          materials from the defflnition of a drug ln
          section 201(g) of the act.

          FLA advises that it not true that all
          natural materials are not drugs. lt has

          been estimated that about 23 percent of
          the drugs currently prescribed by

          physicians are plant compounds1 and that
          an additional 23 percent are related to

          plants. Therefore1 fully half of the drugs
          commonly used can be considered plant

          derived. Such commonly used drugs as
          digitalis1 aspirin1 quinidine1 atropine1 and
          hundreds of others were once considered

          herbals. Thus1 the agency fflnds that it
          cannot rely on the distinction of whether

          a product is natural or synthetic in
          deciding whether it is a food or a drug.

          3. Safety
          Section 101.14(b)(3)(ii) provides that1 to

          dustify a claim for a substance that is to
          be consumed at other than decreased

          levels1 the substance must be a food or a
          food ingredient or a component of a food
          .
          lngredient whose use at the levels
          necessary to dustify a claim has been

          demonstrated by the proponent of the
          claim1 to FLA:s satisfaction1 to be safe

          and lawful under the applicable food





                               safety provisions of the act.

                               relevant information required to

                               requirements. FLA will withhold review
                               of the health claim until it is satisffled on

                               these points.
                               1W. Many comments obdected that the

                               proposed safety provisions are
                               unreasonable. A few of these comments

                               specifflcally asserted that herbal
                               supplements would almost universally fail

                               the proposed safety requirements because
                               most herbs are not OhAS for use as a

                               dietary supplement1 are not approved
                               food additives1 and are not the subdect of
                               prior sanctions or are the subdect of prior

                               sanctions that have been waived.
                               Furthermore1 the comments complained

                               that FLA:s process for acting on OhAS
                               aMrmation petitions is notoriously slow

                               and extremely costly. The comments
                               maintained that the proposed safety
                               requirements would discourage

                               manufacturers from submitting health
                               claim petitions for dietary supplements1

                               would delay the approval of such
                               petitions1 and could well amount to a

                               total ban on health claims for certain
                               dietary supplements. The comments

                               suggested that FLA require safety
                               determinations only for those substances
                               with no history of safe use and provide

                               that the absence of ynown safety





          problems will be suMcient proof of safety

          for substances with a long history of use.

          Other comments urged FLA to be

          fflexible in its determination of safety for


          substances in dietary supplements. A

          number of these comments stressed the

          importance of FLA recogniking that

          safety can be determined solely through

          the historical use of such substances.

          Some of the comments noted that many

          components of supplements1 particularly

          herbs1 have been used for hundreds or

          thousands of years without safety

          problems. The comments also noted that

          herbs are used safely throughout

          three-fourths of the world as a principal

          means of medicine. The comments


          declared that regulatory authorities in

          Oreat britain1 Oermany1 'apan1 and

          many other nations have researched

          various herbal supplements and found

          them to be safe when consumed at the

          levels of use liyely to be contemplated

          under a health claim petition. One

          comment also noted that information

          concerning accurate dosage1 indications1

          contraindications1 and quality control

          measures are also available in past

          editions of the U.S. pharmacopeias and

          National Formularies. These comments

          urged FLA to accept all relevant data on


          the safe use of herbal dietary

          supplements1 including foreign studies

          and monographs that evidence the safety

          of these products. One comment

          declared that FLA is legally bound to

          consider evidence involving herb usage
                                                       .
          outside the United States when reviewlng

          the safety of herbs.


          One comment asserted that FLA should

          evaluate the safety of vitamins and

          minerals in terms of their effect on the

          normal population and not on those

          consumers with unusual conditions or

          sensitivities. The comment acynowledged

          that such consumers need clear label
          .
          lngredient statements as well as

          education on foods to deal with their

          problems. The comment asserted1

          however1 that these consumers should be

          held responsible for some degree of

          self-protection. The comment maintained


          that this approach is consistent with the

          agency:s policy on persons with allergies





                               to food components. A few comments
                               asserted that the safety of a dietary

                               supplement should be defflned in terms of
                               whether or not harm may occur under

                               the conditions of use defflned by the
                               supplement:s labeling1 rather than in

                               terms of an arbitrary cutoff such as the
                               hLl. The comment maintained that a

                               systematic review of all components of
                               dietary supplements is not necessary and

                               suggested that the agency undertaye
                               safety reviews on a case-by-case basis

                               where it believes a potential safety
                               concern might exist.

                               Several comments asserted that FLA is
                               not equitable in its concern for the safety

                               of dietary supplements as compared to
                               the safety of other products regulated by
                               the agency. Some comments asserted

                               that the safety record of dietary
                               supplements is far better than many

                               FLA-approved food additives such as
                               aspartame1 against which1 according to

                               the comments1 the agency receives and
                               ignores thousands of consumer

                               complaints annually. Other comments
                               asserted that FLA:s intense interest in

                               the safety of products would be better
                               focused on prescription drugs1 which are

                               responsible for over 1)2 million deaths
                               annually as compared to the no or few
                               deaths attributable to the consumption

                               of dietary supplements.

                               Nowever1 several comments supported
                               FLA:s proposal to require that
                               petitioners for a health claim for a

                               substance in a dietary supplement
                               demonstrate that the substance is safe

                               and lawful. The comments agreed with
                               the agency that such a requirement is

                               implicit in the act1 and that the labeling
                               law in no way diminishes FLA:s

                               responsibility to ensure the safety of
                               foods.

                               FLA concludes that the preliminary
                               requirement that the safety of a

                               substance be demonstrated should apply
                               to substances in dietary supplements in

                               the same manner that it applies to
                               substances in foods in conventional food

                               form. The amendment to the act enacted
                               by the 1990 amendments cannot be
                               implemented independently of the

                               remaining portions of the act (see section





          9 of the 1990 amendments). The act
          must be considered as a whole1 and

          FLA:s responsibility for ensuring the
          safety of foods is explicitly provided for
          .
          ln other sections of the act (see sections
          201(s)1 402(a)(l) and (2)1 and 409 of the

          act).
          As the agency explained in the dietary

          supplement health claims proposal1 the
          fact that the act contains such explicit

          safety authority is particularly signifflcant
          because the agency will be specifflcally

          authoriking the health claims that will be
          made. ln view of this aMrmative action1

          FLA authorikation of a health claim
          places the agency:s imprimatur on the

          claim. Moreover1 the claim will
          encourage consumption of the substance.
          lt would be a violation of the agency:s

          responsibility under the act to authorike
          a health claim about a substance1

          whether it be in a dietary supplement or
          in food in conventional food form1

          without being satisffled that the use of
          the substance is safe. Certainly1 FLA

          would have almost no assurance that it
          would be protecting the public health if
          .
          lt permitted1 as some comments suggest1
          all substances except those that are

          actually ynown to cause safety problems
          to be the subdect of health claims. lt
          would be a great and tragic irony if

          substances that were the subdect of
          health claims because of one effect caused

          indury because of another. This is the
          situation that Congress sought to avert

          by including section 403(r)(3)(A)(ii) in
          the act. FLA:s preliminary requirement

          is fully consistent with the principles that
          underlie that section.

          The fact that some herbs and other
          lngredients of dietary supplements have.

          been used for thousands of years does
          not necessarily dustify a conclusion by

          FLA that their use under all conditions.
          ls safe1 but it may. First1 FLA needs a

          basis for concluding that such use was in
          fact without harmful effect. Second1
          FLA needs a basis for concluding that

          consumption of ingredients in a
          supplement carrying a health claim

          would be in amounts comparable to
          those consumed safely in the past. The

          proponents of claims for such substances





                               are certainly free to demonstrate that the
                               use of those substances is generally

                               recogniked as safe based on their common
                               use in food prior to 193W. The agency
                               notes1 however1 that the use of many of

                               these substances has been primarily as a
                               drug1 tonic1 or foly remedy1 rather than

                               as food (see 33 Fh 10344 at 10343; May
                               101 19WW). This fact is confflrmed by some
                               of the comments summariked above. As

                               drugs1 the levels and frequency of use of
                               these substances may have been

                               signifflcantly different than the levels and
                               frequency of use that will result from

                               their use as foods. Although the agency
                               will consider evidence involving herb
                               usage outside the United States1 FLA

                               still needs to review data on the identity
                               of the substance1 the safety of the

                               substance1 the use of the substance in
                               food1 the context of its use1 and the

                               frequency of use in the country where use
                               of the substance occurred (see 30 Fh
                               21294 at 212931 'uly 21 19W3). Evidence

                               that another country has studied the
                               safety of an herbal supplement and found

                               it to be safe would certainly be relevant
                               and should be submitted to FLA. lt is

                               important1 however1 that as much of the
                               evidence that provided the basis for the
                               country:s determination as is possible be

                               submitted to FLA.
                               Although formal recognition of safety by

                               FLA admittedly can be lengthy and
                               expensive1 such formal recognition is not

                               required under this preliminary
                               requirement. ln responding to concerns

                               raised by comments suggesting that FLA
                               recognike manufacturers: private OhAS
                               determinations1 the agency stated in the

                               health claims fflnal rule the following
                               concerning y101.14(b)(3)(ii) (3W Fh 241W

                               at 2302 through 2303):
                               FLA acynowledges that the OhAS

                               aMrmation and food additive listing
                               process can be lengthy. Thus1 FLA

                               designed y101.14(b)(3)(ii) to provide
                               fflexibility with respect to the type of
                               showing of safety that is necessary to

                               maye a substance eligible to be the
                               subdect of a health claim. OhAS

                               aMrmation and food additive listing are
                               but two of the procedures by which a

                               substance may meet this preliminary





          requirement.

          FLA intends to consider the basis of
          manufacturers: independent OhAS
          determinations where such

          determinations are submitted with
          petitions for health claims and may use

          its discretion to accept1 without formal
          aMrmation1 the independent

          determination of OhAS where FLA
          believes that such action would be

          appropriate. As FLA pointed out in the
          previous comment1 however1 the agency

          would not be fulffllling its responsibilities
          under the act if it were to permit a

          substance to be the subdect of a health
          claim without satisfying itself that the
          use of that substance is safe.

          Although FLA will consider all
          manufacturers: independent OhAS

          determinations where the basis for such
          determinations are submitted with

          petitions for health claims1 the agency
          advises that it will generally not be

          possible for FLA to dudge whether
          OhAS determinations based on complex

          scientifflc evidence are valid within the
          short timeframes mandated under the

          1990 amendments for health claims
          petitions. lnstead1 agency agreement
          with an independent determination that

          a substance is OhAS will be most liyely
          where the substance is an ingredient1 or a

          component of a food ingredient1 that was
          ln common use in food prior to 'anuary.

          11 193W1 in a similar context. Nowever1
          where such agreement occurs1 the

          agreement does not constitute OhAS
          aMrmation. lnstead1 the history of

          common use in food1 coupled with the
          fact that FLA ynows of no reason to

          question the safety of the food ingredient1
          means that the substance will be treated
          as if it is an unlisted OhAS substance (as

          provided for in y110.30(d) and 1W2.l(a)
          (21 CFh 110.30(d) and 1W2.l(a))) in the

          manner provided for in the food
          lngredient list in 21 CFh part 1W2..

          (3W Fh 241W at 2303.)
          Under this fflnal rule1 this statement is

          fully applicable to substances in dietary
          supplements. The agency believes that

          this policy on independent
          determinations that a substance is OhAS

          demonstrates that FLA will be fflexible in





                                assessing conformance with the safety

                                preliminary requirement.
                                FLA disagrees with assertions that the

                                agency should evaluate the safety of
                                dietary supplements in terms of only the

                                normal population. lt would be
                                unconscionable for the agency to adopt a
                                policy of ignoring adverse effects1 some of

                                which could be life-threatening1 of any
                                foods1 including dietary supplements1 on

                                vulnerable segments of the population.
                                Furthermore1 there is no basis under the

                                act for such a policy. FLA does attempt1
                                however1 to fflnd the most practicable

                                solutions to assuring consumers of a safe
                                food supply. For example1 the agency

                                generally does not base safety decisions
                                on atypical population subgroups that

                                will use the product. Where there are
                                subgroups of consumers (e.g.1 consumers

                                with certain sensitivities) that could
                                suffer adverse effects from consuming the

                                product1 FLA may place certain
                                restrictions on the use of the product or
                                rely on labeling solutions (such as those

                                the agency has used for sulfflting agents
                                and yellow 3) as a condition for its safe

                                use1 rather than denying the availability

                                Several comments insisted that FLA is
                                misinterpreting the requirements for the

                                scientifflc standard for food in
                                conventional food form as well as for

                                dietary supplements. The comments
                                asserted that the law does not require

                                that there be signifflcant scientifflc
                                agreement that a nutrient)disease

                                relationship has been conclusively
                                established1 but only that the statements

                                made in a claim be supported by the
                                available evidence. As an example1 one of

                                the comments asserted that the





          requirements of the law would be fully

          met by a properly qualiffled label claim

          such as1 44Although no scientifflc

          consensus has been established1 several

          clinical studies suggest that daily

          consumption of Vitamin C as part of a

          well-balanced diet may reduce the

          frequency of colds.:: A number of

          comments asserted that the standards for


          authoriking health claims on foods are

          more stringent than those authoriking

          the use of drug claims. Several comments

          argued that FLA is being unduly

          restrictive by requiring that

          manufacturers perform expensive

          randomiked1 double-blind1

          placebo-controlled tests to prove the

          validity of a claim under the proposed

          regulations. These comments stated that

          such requirements would deter

          manufacturers from seeying new uses for

          herbs and other substances used in


          dietary supplements. The comments

          maintained that a more lenient standard

          would encourage manufacturers to engage
          .
          ln research to develop more healthful

          products. The comments further asserted

          that the disparate treatment of foods and

          drugs is especially unfair when the

          enormous difference in safety factors

          between dietary supplements and

          untested prescription drugs is considered.


          Some of the comments asserted that

          FLA had not been fair to date in its

          evaluations of health claims under this

          standard. One of these comments

          asserted that FLA had approved only

          four of the ten congressionally-proposed

          health claims1 not seven1 as FLA claimed

          in the preamble to the proposed

          regulations.


          Some comments maintained that FLA

          should not require a unanimous or

          near-unanimous consensus among

          experts in order to fflnd that there is

          44signifflcant scientifflc agreement::

          concerning a claim. A few of the

          comments pointed out that the legislative

          history of the 1990 amendments clearly

          indicates that such a level of agreement
          .
          ls not to be required. Other comments

          urged that FLA consider the requirement

          for 44signifflcant scientifflc agreement:: to


          be satisffled as long as there is agreement





                                among a madority of scientists familiar

                                with the research in a given area. These
                                comments noted that Commissioner

                                Kessler offered testimony supporting this
                                interpretation before the U.S. Nouse of

                                hepresentatives Subcommittee on Nealth
                                and the Environment. Other comments

                                maintained that the requirement for
                                44signifflcant scientifflc agreement:: only

                                requires agreement among a signifflcant
                                number of qualiffled experts. One of these
                                comments requested that FLA include a

                                provision in the regulations that the
                                standard of 44signifflcant scientifflc

                                agreement:: is not one of unanimity to
                                prevent confusion among manufacturers

                                and consumers. A few comments asyed
                                that FLA:s regulations include a

                                provision that guarantees that
                                44signifflcant scientifflc agreement:: will be

                                considered to have been achieved when a
                                credible health authority1 particularly an

                                agency of the U.S. Oovernment1
                                recommends the consumption of a

                                nutrient because of its relationship to a
                                disease or health-related condition.

                                One comment suggested that FLA not
                                use the phrase 44signifflcant scientifflc

                                agreement:: to evaluate proposed health
                                claims1 despite its inclusion in the

                                language of the 1990 amendments1
                                because the meaning of the phrase is

                                ambiguous. The comment suggested that
                                FLA should simply consider the totality

                                of publicly available scientifflc evidence to
                                determine whether or not a particular

                                health claim can be dustiffled.

                                FLA disagrees with assertions that it is
                                conducting validity assessments for

                                health claims in an unduly restrictive
                                manner. FLA does not require that

                                manufacturers perform controlled clinical
                                trials to prove the validity of a claim. To

                                the contrary1 as discussed in the health
                                claims fflnal rule (3W Fh 241W at 2300)1
                                the scientifflc standard for health claims

                                is less stringent than the requirements for
                                approval of a new drug. ln the case of a

                                new drug1 section 303(d)(3) of the act
                                (21 U.S.C. 333(d)(3)) states that the

                                Secretary shall refuse to approve an
                                application for approval of such a drug

                                where there is a lacy of substantial
                                evidence that the drug will have the





           effect that it purports or is represented

           to have under the conditions of use
           prescribed1 recommended1 or suggested

           in the proposed labeling thereof. Section
           303(d) provides further that the term

           44substantial evidence:: means evidence
           consisting of adequate and

           well-controlled investigations1 including
           clinical investigations (human studies

           conducted in a controlled clinical
           setting)1 by experts qualiffled by scientifflc
           training and experience to evaluate the

           effectiveness of the drug involved. (The
           statutory term 44substantial evidence::

           should not be confused with the same
           term used by some comments to refer to

           44more than a scintilla and less than a
           preponderance:: of evidence.) based on

           this statutory direction1 the agency has
           identiffled a number of characteristics

           that are present in 44adequate and
           well-controlled:: studies in y314.120 (21

           CFh 314.120).

           Section 101.14(c) of FLA regulations
           does not mandate requirements as

           stringent as those for drugs in section
           303(d)(3) of the act. Section 101.14(c)
           contains no mention of 44substantial

           evidencel:: 44adequate and well-controlled
           investigationsl:: or of 44clinical

           investigations.:: To the contrary1
           y101.14(c) contains more fflexibility than

           the drug provisions of the act because it
           provides FLA with authority to

           authorike claims based on 44scientifflc
           evidence (including evidence from

           well-designed studies conducted in a
           manner which is consistent with

           generally recogniked scientifflc procedures
           and principles)1 that there is signifflcant

           agreement among experts qualiffled by
           scientifflc training and experience to

           evaluate such claims1 that the claim is
           supported by such evidence:: (section

           403(r)(3)(b)(i) of the act).
           Consistent with this fflexibility1 FLA did

           not prescribe a specifflc set1 type1 or
           number of studies as being suMcient to

           support a health claim in the health
           claims fflnal rule that applied to food in

           conventional food form. ln that rule1 the
           agency advised (3W Fh 241W at 2300)

           that it would consider all relevant data
           on a topic1 including clinical studies1





                                epidemiological data1 and animal studies.

                                ln addition1 the 1990 amendments
                                directed FLA to consider 10

                                nutrient-disease relationships. ln the
                                'anuary 01 19931 fflnal rules1 FLA

                                authoriked claims with respect to seven
                                of those 10 relationships (see 3W Fh 23311

                                23321 20221 20031 21391 21W11 and 2W20).
                                ln addition1 FLA has recently proposed

                                to authorike claims concerning an eighth1
                                folic acid and neural tube defects (see 3W
                                Fh 332341 October 141 1993). FLA

                                believes that these approvals
                                demonstrate that it is not conducting

                                validity assessments for health claims in
                                an unduly restrictive manner.

                                FLA agrees that the legislative history of
                                the 1990 amendments mayes clear that

                                Congress did not intend1 in calling for
                                signifflcant scientifflc agreement about the

                                support for a claim1 to require that such
                                agreement represents a full consensus

                                among scientists. The Nouse heport
                                (hef. 1) states:

                                t t t the standard does not require that
                                there be a unanimous agreement among

                                experts. lnstead there must be a
                                signifflcant agreement among experts1 but

                                it does not require that every expert in
                                the ffleld approve or agree with the claim.

                                The agency shares the comments:
                                concern that a requirement of consensus

                                would mean that some valid health
                                claims would not be authoriked and1 by

                                restricting such claims1 would counter
                                Congress: intent that health claims

                                supported by a signifflcant scientifflc
                                agreement be made available to

                                consumers. The agency never intended to
                                require that claims be supported by a

                                consensus among scientists and has not
                                done so.
                                               .
                                The agency ls sensitive to the comments:
                                perception that the scientifflc standard1

                                particularly the phrase 44signifflcant
                                scientifflc agreementl:: is subdective. The

                                agency believes1 however1 that any
                                standard involving the evaluation of

                                scientifflc evidence and opinions derived
                                from that evidence must be somewhat
                                subdective. FLA1 in proposing not to

                                defflne 44signifflcant agreement:: among
                                experts in the November 211 1991 (30 Fh

                                00331 at 0034W) proposal1 noted that





           each situation may differ with the nature

           of the claimed substance)disease
           relationship. The agency believes that in

           deciding whether signifflcant scientifflc
           agreement about the validity of a claim

           exists1 it is necessary to consider both the
           extent of agreement and the nature of

           the disagreement on a case-by-case basis.

           The Nouse heport (hef. 1) mayes clear
           that Congress intended the 44signifflcant

           scientifflc agreement:: standard to be a
          fflexible one by pointing out that1 in
                  .
           reviewlng scientifflc studies1 FLA may
           give greater weight to the studies that it

          fflnds more persuasive. The Nouse heport
           also clariffles that the overriding

           consideration in assessing whether to
           authorike a claim should be the

           Secretary:s level of comfort about the
           validity of the claim. The agency believes

           that this clarifflcation provides clear
           guidance for the application of the

           standard1 and thus it is not incorporating
           the changes requested by the comments

          in the codiffled language of the
           regulations.

           FLA does not believe it has in any way

           been unfair in its approval of health
           claims to date. Earlier in this preamble
           .
          ln response to comment 21 FLA
           explained why certain specifflc health

           claims were not approved. Nevertheless1
           the agency:s statement in the dietary

           supplement health claims proposal that
          it had authoriked claims on 1 of the 10

           nutrient-disease relationships is correct.
           ln the case of 3 of the relationships1

           however1 the claims were authoriked for
          foods rather than specifflc nutrients. ln

           these cases1 as explained previously1
           although there was suMcient evidence to

           was insuMcient evidence to attribute any

                                Ultimately1 the agency must exercise its

                                scientifflc dudgment1 arrived at after input
                                from the scientifflc community.

                                The agency does not agree that
                                signifflcant scientifflc agreement should be

                                considered to have been achieved when a

                                While FLA recognikes the signifflcance of
                                such recommendations1 Congress charged

                                FLA with the responsibility of

                                2O. Many comments applauded the

                                agency:s determination not to underrate
                                any scientifflc evidence on the basis of its

                                cultural or geographic origin. One of
                                these comments noted that the United

                                States is one of the most ethnically
                                diverse nations in the world and stated

                                that a study done anywhere in the world
                                is liyely to be relevant to at least one

                                U.S. subpopulation. A few of these
                                comments noted that some of the studies

                                done on herbal dietary supplements have
                                been conducted under foreign drug

                                protocols and requested assurance that
                                FLA would consider such data to be part

                                of the publicly available scientifflc
                                evidence supporting prospective health
                                claims. Another of these comments

                                asserted that the 44totality of publicly
                                available scientifflc evidence:: should





          include not only 44well designed studies::
           but also ethnobotanical and other

           traditional usage information which is
           often available for herbs and other

           dietary supplements.
           The agency reaMrms its commitment to

           consider any evidence submitted in
           support of the scientifflc merits of a claim

           and in the context of the totality of
           available evidence. FLA will not

           underrate any study on the basis of its
           cultural or geographic origin. Evidence
           .
          ln support of a proposed health claim1
           however1 will attain value in direct

           proportion to the signifflcance in the U.S.
           population of the effects of the substance
           .
          ln question on the disease or
           health-related condition addressed by the
           claim (see y101.14(b)(l)). Also1 the

           agency advises that it will consider
           ethnobotanical and other traditional

           usage information. Nowever1 the agency
           points out that under y101.14(c)1 the

           evidence must provide the basis for
           signifflcant scientifflc agreement that the

           claim is valid.
           L. Oeneral Labeling hequirements

           ln the health claims fflnal rule1 FLA
           established a number of general

           requirements for health claims for food in
           conventional food form in y101.14(d) to

           ensure that consumers are provided with
           valid and reliable information about the

           value that ingestion (or reduced.
          lngestion) of a particular substance1 as

           part of a total dietary pattern1 may have.
          ln affecting certain diseases or
           health-related conditions.

           ln the dietary supplement health claims
           proposal1 the agency proposed that

           dietary supplements be subdect to the
           same general requirements that it has

           established for food in conventional food
          form in y101.14(d). The agency advised

           that specifflc references to dietary
           supplements in y101.14(d) are not

           necessary because FLA:s revision of
           y101.14(a)(2)1 the defflnition of the term

           44substancel:: to include components of
           dietary supplements will liny dietary

           supplements to the health claim for
           which y101.14(d) prescribes general
           requirements.

           1. FLA Authorikation of Valid Claims





                                 Section 101.14(d)(l) provides that when
                                 FLA determines that a health claim is

                                 valid1 the agency will propose a
                                 regulation in Subpart E of part 101 to

                                 authorike the use of the claim. Further1
                                 the provision states that if the claim

                                 pertains to a substance not provided for.
                                 ln y101.91 FLA will propose to amend
                                 that regulation to include declaration of

                                 the substance. To ensure that the
                                 provisions established in y101.14(d)(l)

                                 apply equally to all forms of dietary
                                 supplements1 the agency proposed in the

                                 dietary supplement proposal to revise
                                 y101.14(d)(l) to reference1 in addition to

                                 y101.91 the provisions of y101.30 (21 CFh
                                 101.30)1 which establish requirements for
                                 the nutrition labeling of dietary

                                 supplements of vitamins and minerals.
                                 FLA received no comments requesting

                                 changes in this aspect of the proposal.
                                 Therefore1 the agency ls adoptlng this..

                                 section as proposed.

                                 Section 101.14(d)(2) requires that health

                                 be suMciently low to dustify the claim.

                                 For example1 if a defflnition for use of the
                                 term 44low:: has been established for that





          substance1 the substance must be present
          at a level that meets the requirements for

          use of that term1 unless a specifflc
          alternative level has been established for

          the substance in the authoriking
          regulation. lf the claim is about the

          effects of consuming the substance at
          other than decreased dietary levels1 the
          level of the substance in the food must

          be suMciently high and in an appropriate
          form to dustify the claim. For example1 if

          a defflnition for use of the term 44high:: for
          that substance has been established1 the

          substance must be present at a level that
          meets the requirements for use of that

          term1 unless a specifflc alternative level
          has been established for the substance in
          the authoriking regulation. (See

          y101.14(d)(2)(vii)(A) for additional
          requirements where the food meets the

           44high:: or 44low:: requirements based on
          its reference amount customarily

          consumed and the labeled serving sike
          differs from that amount. See

          y101.14(d)(2)(vii)(b) for guidance about
          how a food can meet the 44high:: and
           44low:: requirements where the food is

          sold in a restaurant.)

          ln the dietary supplement health claims
          proposal1 FLA proposed that dietary
          supplements be subdect to these

          requirements to ensure that consumers
          are provided with scientifflcally valid1

          nonmisleading1 and reliable information
          about the value that ingestion of the

          particular substance in the dietary
          supplement may have in affecting a

          disease or health-related condition.
          2l. One comment stated that FLA

          should mandate that dietary
          supplements bear health claims for which

          they are eligible in order to promote
          public awareness of the benefflts
          associated with those supplements.

          FLA does not believe that it is

          appropriate to adopt a general policy
          requiring the inclusion of health claims
          on the labels of all foods eligible to bear

          them. The agency notes that while the
          1990 amendments provide for the

          appearance of health claims on the labels
          of foods qualiffled to bear them1 they do

          not maye the appearance of those claims
          mandatory.





                                FLA believes that many manufacturers

                                will choose to include health claims on
                                the labels of qualiffled foods because of
                                the maryeting benefflt offered by their

                                appearance. because health claims
                                provide information regarding the

                                benefflts associated with the increased or
                                decreased dietary intaye of various

                                substances in the product rather than
                                information regarding the particular

                                product itself1 consumers will be made
                                aware of the benefflts of consuming other

                                foods that do or do not contain the
                                particular substance1 even if a particular

                                food product does not itself bear the
                                health claim.

                                22. One comment asserted that FLA
                                should require manufacturers who elect

                                to craft their own health claims1 rather
                                than to use the model claim verbatim1 to

                                secure agency approval for their claims
                                with respect to understandability.

                                FLA disagrees with this comment.
                                Section 3(b)(l)(A)(vii) of the 1990

                                amendments prohibits FLA from
                                requiring persons to secure agency

                                approval before placing a health claim on
                                a product1 provided that the claim is in

                                this section 44mayes it clear that the
                                regulations will not require premaryet

                                review of each claim; they will only
                                require that the claim be consistent with

                                the terms and requirements of the
                                regulations.:: The agency believes that it

                                the terms and requirements of the
                                regulations permitting that claim. This

                                position is similar to agency
                                policy that permits the use of

                                terminology other than that established
                                ln a fflnal OTC drug monograph in.

                                1023W1 May 11 19WO). Consistent with
                                that policy for OTC drug labeling1 the

                                agency believes that the goal of ensuring
                                scientifflcally valid1 truthful1 and

                                nonmisleading labeling without inhibiting
                                effective consumer communication does
                                not require exclusive use of language in a





           model health claim. The model language
           along with other requirements for a claim
           will1 nevertheless1 provide the standard

          for measuring the accuracy of alternative
          language developed by food

           manufacturers for their products because
           FLA has included all mandatory labeling

           elements of a health claim in the model
           claim. Of course1 manufacturers should
           recognike that a health claim that fails to

           convey all the mandatory elements of the
           claim will subdect a product to

           regulatory action.
           3. Nutrition Labeling

           Section 101.14(d)(3) requires that health
           claims on foods in conventional food
          form must bear nutrition labeling ln      .

           accordance with y101.9 and 101.10 (21
           CFh 101.9 and 101.10). ln the dietary

           supplement health claims proposal1 the
           agency proposed to revise y101.14(d) to

           reference y101.30 (21 CFh 101.30)1 in
           addition to y101.9 and 101.10. ln
           response to section 403(q)(3)(F) of the

           act (formerly section 403(q)(3)(E))1
           y101.30 establishes requirements for the

           nutrition labeling of dietary supplements
           of vitamins and minerals.

           FLA received no comments requesting
           changes in this aspect of the proposal.
           Therefore1 the agency ls adopting this.

           section as proposed.
           E. prohibited Nealth Claims

           ln y101.14(e) of the health claims fflnal
           rule1 FLA established1 for foods in

           conventional food form1 a number of
           situations where health claims are
           prohibited. ln that paragraph1 FLA

           provides that a health claim may not be
           made on the label or in the labeling of a

          food unless: (l) The claim is specifflcally
           provided for in authoriking regulations in

           Subpart E of 21 CFh part 101; (2) the
           claim conforms to all general provisions
           of

           y101.141 as well as to all specifflc
           provisions in the authoriking regulation;

           (3) none of the disqualifying levels
          identiffled in y101.14(a)(3) is exceeded in
           the food1 unless specifflc alternative levels

           have been established for the substance
          in the authoriking regulation1 and the

          labeling bears a statement that complies
           with y101.13(h) highlighting the nutrient





                                that exceeds the disqualifying level; (4)
                                no substance is present at an

                                inappropriate level as determined in the
                                specifflc provision authoriking the claim
                                ln Subpart E of 21 CFh part 101; (3) the.

                                label does not represent or purport that
                                the food is for infants and toddlers less

                                than 2 years of age except if the claim is
                                specifflcally provided for in Subpart E of

                                21 CFh part 101; and (O) except for
                                dietary supplements1 the food contains
                                                                             .

                                ln the dietary supplement health claims

                                proposal1 the agency proposed that
                                dietary supplements be subdect to the

                                general prohibitions that have been
                                established for foods in conventional food

                                form in y101.14(e). The agency
                                tentatively concluded that this action

                                was appropriate because these
                                prohibitions: (l) hefflect the statutory
                                restriction in section 403(r)(l)(b) of the

                                act that requires that health claims be
                                made in accordance with the provisions

                                of section 403(r)(3)(L) for dietary
                                supplements; (2) ensure that

                                inappropriate1 unsubstantiated1 and
                                fraudulent health claims are not made;
                                and (3) reduce the potential for

                                consumer confusion when confronted
                                with a situation in which there would be

                                health claims for substances when they
                                are present in dietary supplements but

                                not when they are present in foods in
                                conventional food form. The agency
                                advised that specifflc references to dietary

                                supplements in y101.14(e) generally are
                                not necessary because FLA:s proposed

                                revision in y101.14(a)(2) of the defflnition
                                of the term 44substance:: to include

                                components of dietary supplements will
                                bring dietary supplements within the
                                coverage of y101.14(e).

                                FLA did propose1 however1 to include a

                                reference to dietary supplements in the
                                introductory sentence of paragraph (e) to
                                clarify that dietary supplements may be

                                food. Specifflcally1 FLA proposed to
                                insert the phrase 44regardless of whether

                                the food is in conventional food form or
                                dietary supplement form:: into that





          sentence to maye clear that no expressed

          or implied health claims may be made on
          the label or in labeling of any food unless
          the conditions in that paragraph are met.

          1. Claims Not Authoriked by FLA

          Section 101.14(e)(l) and (e)(2) prohibit
          the use on a food label or in food

          labeling of any claim that expressly or by
          implication characterikes the relationship
          of any substance to a disease or

          health-related condition unless: (l) The
          claim is specifflcally provided for in part

          1011 Subpart E       Specifflc hequirements
          for Nealth Claims; and (2) the claim

          conforms to all general provisions of
          y101.141 as well as to all specifflc

          provisions in the appropriate section in
          subpart E of 21 CFh part 101.

          23. A number of comments asserted that
          the maryetplace is currently saturated

          with hundreds of false and misleading
          claims1 ranging from rather innocuous

          statements to blatant claims concerning
          the treatment of cancer1 AlLS1 heart

          disease1 asthma1 high blood pressure1
          Alkheimer:s disease1 diabetes1 and other
          diseases and health-related conditions.

          One of these comments urged FLA to
          regulate as implied health claims those

          brand names that imply that a product
          ls useful in preventing particular.

          diseases. The comment asserted that an
          implied health claim can be made by the

          inclusion of the name of a disease in a
          brand name1 as well as by label

          statements that slant the meaning of a
          brand name toward disease prevention.

          FLA realikes there are a number of
          misleading claims in use on products.

          The agency reviews these claims as part
          of its regular enforcement activities and

          tayes action against such claims based on
          such factors as the public health

          signifflcance of the claim1 how clearly it
          violates the act1 and the availability of
          agency resources.

          24. A number of comments stated that
          manufacturers should be allowed to

          include information on the traditional
          use of various supplements on their

          labels. These comments noted that many
          other countries allow supplement labels

          to indicate traditional uses of the
          product1 provided that the level of





                                evidence supporting such use is
                                accurately represented. Many comments

                                asserted that statements concerning the
                                safe usage of dietary supplements should

                                not be considered a health claim. The
                                comments maintained that the exclusion

                                of such information from food labeling
                                would endanger the public health.

                                substance to a disease or a health-related

                                for a food. (See section lll.O. of this
                                document.) Any such petition that shows

                                that the preliminary requirements in
                                y101.14(b) and the scientifflc standard for

                                a health claim in y101.14(c) are met will
                                provide the basis for a proposal to

                                authorike a claim in accordance with
                                section 403(r)(4)(A)(i) of the act.

                                ln addition1 FLA advises manufacturers
                                of dietary supplements that where a

                                claim does not include one or both of the
                                basic elements of a health claim1 lt    .

                                generally constitutes dietary guidance
                                that may be provided on the label or in

                                labeling1 so long as it is presented in a
                                truthful and nonmisleading manner.

                                23. One comment urged that FLA
                                permit the appearance of preliminary

                                health claims on the labeling of a product
                                other than its label. The comment
                                maintained that the 1990 amendments

                                draw a clear distinction between a





          product label and its labeling and noted

          that labeling has much more room in
          which a manufacturer may suMciently
          explain the current state of scientifflc

          evidence regarding a preliminary claim.

          FLA disagrees with this comment.
          Section 403(r)(l) of the act clearly
          prohibits the appearance of health claims

          that are not made in accordance with
          FLA regulations and that appear 44 in

          the label or labeling of the food
           (emphasis added).:: The agency:s

          obdections to preliminary claims are fully
          discussed in this preamble in its response

          to comment 4.

           y101.14(e)(O) to require consistency with
          dietary guidelines by prohibiting health

          claims unless the food contains 10
          percent or more of the hLl or LhV for

          vitamin A1 vitamin C1 iron1 calcium1
          protein1 or fflber per reference amount

          customarily consumed prior to any
          nutrient addition. (A complete discussion

          of why these specifflc criteria were
          selected appears in the preamble of that

          document (see 3W Fh 241W at 2321
          through 2322).) This provision stresses

          the importance of selecting foods so that
          dietary sources of calories are coupled

          with sources of nutrients. This approach
          incorporates established levels of
          signifflcance for nutrients in food and is

          based on the amounts in foods of certain
          nutrients required to be listed on the

          label as part of mandatory nutrition
          labeling. As such1 this approach applies

          to food in conventional food form.
          FLA specifflcally exempted dietary

          supplements from this requirement. Such
          supplements are intended only to provide

          nutritive value to the daily diet1 and they
          maye no pretense of serving as

          substitutes for conventional food.
           (Nutrient supplements in conventional

          food form are1 however1 intended to serve
          as substitutes for conventional food.) As

          a result1 it would not be logical to hold
          such products to criteria designed to

          ensure consistency with dietary
          guidelines for conventional food. A

          dietary supplement that meets the





                                qualifying criterion in y101.14(d)(2)(vii)
                                and that does not contain a nutrient at a

                                disqualifying level speciffled in
                                y101.14(a)(3) possesses nutritive value

                                for a health claim irrespective of whether
                                or not it may also provide calories.

                                Accordingly1 in the dietary supplement
                                health claims proposal1 FLA did not
                                propose to maye any change in the

                                exemption for dietary supplements from
                                the provisions of y101.14(e)(O). For

                                consistency with the proposed defflnition
                                of the term 44dietary supplementl::

                                however1 FLA proposed to revise the
                                wording for this exemption to delete the

                                phrase 44not in conventional food form::
                                because the defflnition of 44dietary
                                supplement:: states that such foods are

                                not in conventional food form.
                                FLA received no comments requesting

                                changes in this aspect of the proposal.
                                Therefore1 the agency ls adoptlng this..

                                section as proposed.
                                F. Applicability

                                ln the health claims fflnal rule1 FLA
                                established a provision in y101.14(g)

                                stating that the requirements for health
                                claims in y101.14 apply to foods intended

                                for human consumption that are offered
                                for sale. ln the dietary supplement

                                proposal1 FLA proposed that dietary
                                supplements also be covered by
                                y101.14(g). FLA stated that it had

                                tentatively concluded that a reference to
                                dietary supplements was appropriate in

                                paragraph (g) to clarify that dietary
                                supplements can be food. Specifflcally1

                                FLA proposed to revise paragraph (g) as
                                follows:

                                Applicability . The requirements of this
                                section apply to foods intended for

                                human consumption that are offered for
                                sale1 regardless of whether the foods are
                                ln conventional food form or dietary.

                                supplement form.
                                2O. One comment asserted that FLA

                                should allow health claims authoriked for
                                use on dietary supplements to also

                                appear on OTC drug products that
                                provide 44high:: levels of a particular

                                nutrient1 e.g.1 calcium-osteoporosis claims
                                on calcium carbonate antacid tablets.

                                FLA received a comment similar to this
                                one on the health claims proposal. This





          comment provides no basis for the

          agency to provide a different response to
          this comment than it did in the health
          claims fflnal rule.

          As explained in the preamble of the
          health claims fflnal rule (3W Fh 241W at

          2300)1 multiple use products that are
          both foods and drugs present a diMcult

          set of competing concerns for the agency.
          Such products are liyely to be both an

          OTC drug and a dietary supplement.
          Most OTC drug products are developed

          to address some type of acute medical
          problem that is expected to be of short

          duration. lf the problem persists1 it is
          important that the person with the

          problem ynow that it may be more
          severe than he or she otherwise thought1

          and that he or she should seey medical
          attention. Labeling on such products1

          therefore1 includes instructions to use the
          product for a limited period of time and1

          if the problem persists1 to seey medical
          intervention. Thus1 the time limits on
          use of the product are important to the

          health of the users.

          Lietary supplements1 on the other hand1
          are developed for inclusion in a daily diet
          at levels that are consistent with dietary

          use and may often be consumed
          throughout most of a person:s lifetime.

          Labeling on dietary supplements contains
          no instructions for seeying medical

          intervention or for limiting the duration
          of consumption of the supplement.

          hather1 under the new regulations1
          dietary supplements will be able to bear

          nutrient content and health claims1 which
          focus the consumer:s attention on the

          advantages that consuming the product
          will have in helping the consumer to

          maintain a healthy diet. Moreover1 where
          the supplement bears a health claim1 the
          claim will contain information about how

          long-term ingestion of the supplement
          may promote health.

          Where dietary levels and therapeutic
          levels differ (as is generally the case and

          is in fact the case with antacids and
          calcium supplements)1 an apparent

          confflict is created when both food and
          drug labeling appear on the same

          product. ln the case of the drug labeling1
          consumers are given directions for use





                                that involve high consumption during a

                                limited time period. ln the case of the
                                food labeling1 consumers are given

                                directions for lower consumption with no
                                time constraints. Even though label

                                instructions may identify those directions
                                for food and drug use in separate
                                locations1 FLA is concerned that

                                consumers will incorrectly assume that
                                the therapeutic dosage is appropriate for

                                dietary use1 and that the directions for
                                food use will undercut the warning in the

                                drug labeling to seey medical care if the
                                condition persists. Where the labeling ls     .

                                not properly followed1 signifflcant adverse
                                consequences may result.

                                The agency ynows of no broad approach
                                that it can use to harmonike a nutrient

                                content claim or a health claim with drug
                                labeling. A drug that is labeled with

                                instructions for use that both limit and
                                do not limit consumption would be

                                misbranded under section 302(a) of the
                                act (21 U.S.C. 332(a)) if it failed to

                                contain a material fact that is1 how to
                                reconcile these confflicting instructions.

                                Nowever1 FLA does not believe that it
                                would be appropriate to preclude such

                                claims under all circumstances. Such
                                claims may be permissible if a fflrm can

                                demonstrate that dual claims can be
                                made in a manner that will neither

                                misbrand the product nor create a safety
                                problem. The agency suggests that

                                anyone desiring to maye a health claim
                                or a nutrient content claim that complies

                                with section 403(r) of the act on a

                                2l. A number of comments urged FLA
                                to streamline its procedures for

                                approving health claims in order that
                                dietary supplement manufacturers may

                                include the most current1 reliable
                                information on their products. The
                                comments stated that the inclusion of

                                such information is critically important





          to dietary supplements because1 unliye
          foods in conventional food form1 they are

          consumed only for the health benefflts
          associated with them. The comments

          specifflcally proposed that FLA add the
          following paragraphs to y101.10(d):

           (4) Final hule . FLA will1 within 120
          days of the date of publication of the

          proposed rule1 issue a fflnal rule
          authoriking or prohibiting the requested

          use of the health claim.
           (3) Expedited Action on certain petitions

           . lf FLA determines during its initial
          review of the petition that it accurately
          represents the recommendations of any

          agency or department of the U.S.
          Oovernment with public health

          responsibilities1 or of any other public
          health organikation that is recogniked as

          a credible source of information on diet
          and health1 FLA will publish a proposed

          rule authoriking the requested use of the
          claim no later than 00 days from the date
          of receipt of the petition and will issue a

          fflnal rule no later than 00 days from the
          date of publication of the proposed rule.

          The comments maintained that new
          provision in paragraph (d)(4) would

          correct an obvious oversight in the
          existing regulations1 i.e.1 the

          establishment of a fflrm deadline for a
          proposed rule but no fflrm deadline for a

          fflnal rule. The comments also contended
          that paragraph (d)(3) is necessary to
          address FLA:s failure to act promptly to

          approve claims that are based on the
          recommendations of public health

          authorities1 such as its failure to approve
          a health claim for folic acid in accord

          with the recommendations of pNS
          agencies.

          FLA advises that its failure to specify in
           y101.10(d) a deadline for the publication

          of a fflnal rule regarding the use of a
          proposed health claim was not an

          oversight. Section 403(r)(4)(A)(i) does
          not require that the agency adhere to
          any deadline for the publication of a fflnal

          rule. While FLA could establish such a
          timeframe by regulation1 it does not

          believe that the adoption of such a
          requirement would be prudent. The

          comment period following the
          publication of proposed rules is a critical





                                step in determining whether a proposed

                                regulation is appropriate for adoption. ln

                                the instance of health claim regulations1

                                signifflcant information concerning the

                                validity of the substance-disease

                                relationship underlying the proposed

                                health claim may be submitted by

                                interested parties during the comment

                                period. Also1 the comment period may


                                bring to light a previously unforeseen

                                potential for the use of a health claim1 if

                                adopted without modifflcation1 to be

                                misleading to consumers or to create

                                serious potential threats to the public

                                health. The agency has no way to

                                guarantee that it will be able to

                                adequately resolve such problems within

                                the suggested timeframe. ln such

                                instances1 if faced with a specifflc

                                timeframe1 FLA would be forced to

                                either deny an otherwise valid health

                                claim petition1 or to approve it without


                                erecting the regulatory framewory that it

                                believes necessary to ensure that the

                                public health is safeguarded. Therefore1
                                                      .
                                FLA is not adoptlng the suggested time

                                limit on the issuance of a fflnal rule.

                                Nowever1 the agency advises that it

                                committed to issuing fflnal rules on health

                                claim petitions as quicyly as possible

                                consistent with the issues presented and

                                the agency:s available resources.


                                With respect to suggestions for shorter

                                timeframes for certain petitions1 FLA

                                advises that the agency:s ability to meet

                                timeframes is inffluenced by many factors1

                                such as wory priorities and availability of

                                personnel. FLA considers the statutory

                                timeframes for assessing the validity of


                                health claims and for issuing a proposed

                                regulation to be extremely short1 given

                                the need to evaluate the totality of

                                available scientifflc evidence on a

                                substance and a disease or a

                                health-related condition. Oiven the

                                agency:s limited resources1 it would not

                                be practicable to shorten these

                                timeframes further. Nowever1 FLA

                                points out that although action on

                                petitions for most claims will require

                                virtually all of the time provided by the

                                statutory timeframes1 nothing would

                                                                        .
                                prohibit the agency from acting ln less

                                time than the timeframes provide if it is





          possible to do so. Thus1 it is liyely that a

          petition for a claim on a well-accepted
          substance)disease relationship would be

          reviewed more expeditiously than one for
          which scientifflc agreement is not as clear.

          2W. A few comments urged FLA to

          consider the limited label space available
          on many dietary supplements in

          developing model health claims. The
          comments stated that concise model
          claims will provide guidance to

          manufacturers on how to convey health
          claims in succinct statements that

          comply with all of FLA:s requirements
          and will thus help ensure that the health

          claims presented to consumers are clear
          and comprehensible.

          FLA realikes that there is a limit to the

          amount of information that can be
          presented on a food label. Nowever1 the

          agency believes that it must ensure that
          consumers understand that factors other

          than dietary intaye of the nutrient may
          bear on the substance-disease

          relationship. Oiven the imperative of
          ensuring consumer understanding of a

          message that must be presented in a very
          limited space1 the agency is faced with

          the diMcult tasy of determining what
          information is necessary ln a claim1 and.

          what information is not. FLA believes
          that its regulations in subpart E of 21

          CFh part 101 represent an acceptable
          balance between the consumer:s right to

          understand the full context of the claim
          and the manufacturer:s concern over

          claim length. by delineating the
          information that is mandatory and

          optional in a claim1 FLA is relieving
          manufacturers from having to include

          information that is of tangential
          importance but ensuring that those who

          wish to maye a claim do so in a manner
          that provides a useful and

          understandable message to consumers.
          FLA advises that it will taye a similar

          approach when providing model health
          claims in the future. FLA also notes that

          manufacturers who are not satisffled with
          the model claim are free to develop their

          own versions of the claim1 provided that
          those versions include all of the

          information required by the authoriking
          regulation.





                                29. Several comments raised the issue of
                                product-specifflc health claims by

                                asserting that many manufacturers will
                                be dissuaded from undertaying the

                                scientifflc studies and other investments
                                necessary to obtain approval of new

                                health claims petitions by the fact that
                                approved health claims will be allowed

                                for use on all qualifying products.
                                Nowever1 a number of comments stressed
                                that in a health claim1 the role of the

                                total diet should be emphasiked rather
                                than the role of a specifflc food in risy

                                reduction.

                                FLA advises that section 403(r)(l)(b) of
                                the act pertains to a claim about the
                                relationship between a nutrient and a

                                disease or health-related condition1 rather
                                than about particular food product and

                                such a condition. While the agency has
                                used the term 44substance:: in lieu of the

                                word 44nutrient:: and has said that a
                                44substance:: can be a food1 in doing so

                                the agency was only trying to cover
                                circumstances such as those presented by

                                fruits1 vegetables1 and grain products in
                                which it was not possible to identify the
                                specifflc nutrient in a broad class of foods

                                that was having the observed effect on
                                the risy of disease. FLA was not thereby

                                including formulated products as possible
                                subdects of health claims. Such products

                                are formulated to include particular
                                substances because of the nutritional

                                effects of those substances. Thus1 a
                                health claim for such a product would
                                appropriately be about the substance in

                                the formulated product and not about
                                the product itself.

                                ln addition1 section 403(r)(3)(b)(iii) of

                                the act directs the agency to require that
                                health claims enable the public to
                                understand the information in the

                                context of the total daily diet. As
                                explained above1 FLA fflnds that to effect

                                Congress: intent in passing the 1990
                                amendments1 the same requirement

                                should apply to health claims made on
                                dietary supplements. FLA believes that

                                a claim that refers specifflcally to the
                                effects on a disease or health-related

                                condition resulting from the consumption
                                of a certain brand name of product
                                would unduly emphasike the importance





          of that product and not the importance
          of the total daily diet. Also1 such claims

          could imply that other brands of the
          same food1 as well as other foods

          containing the substance that is the
          subdect of the claim1 might not have the

          same effect on the disease or
          health-related condition and thus would

          be misleading under section 403(a) of the
          act. Accordingly1 the agency fflnds that it
          .
          ls not appropriate to approve
          product-specifflc health claims.

          3O. One comment suggested that FLA
          provide regular monthly or quarterly

          reports concerning newly approved
          health claim petitions for display in the
          supplement section of stores. The

          comment maintained that such a list
          distributed by FLA would increase

          consumer conffldence in the claims when
          they appear on supplement labels.

          Although FLA recognikes that there
          could be benefflts to consumers from such

          reports1 the agency simply does not have
          the resources to provide the reports on
                   .
          an ongolng basis. Nowever1 FLA expects
          that trade associations and other

          interested parties will provide
          information to fflrms that will ultimately

          be passed on to consumers.

          3l. Several comments raised concerns
          that the regulations violate the First

          Amendment. Comments cautioned that
          the regulations would be unconstitutional

          if they limited the dissemination of
          scientifflc opinion or prevented
          scientifflcally valid1 well-balanced

          information from reaching the public.
          ln the fflnal rule on health claims for

          foods in conventional food form1 3W Fh
          241W at 2324 through 232W ('anuary 01

          1993)1 the agency addressed in detail the
          First Amendment implications of its

          regulation of health claims on the food
          label and in food labeling. The agency

          concluded that its regulations1 and the
          act as amended by the 1990 amendments1

          do not violate the First Amendment.
          FLA considers its earlier analysis to be
          relevant to the present rulemaying and

          incorporates it into this document. The





                                agency notes that none of the comments
                                submitted on the proposed rule on health

                                claims for dietary supplements disputed
                                the agency:s earlier discussion1 and no

                                comments argued that subsequent court
                                decisions have called the agency:s

                                conclusions into question.
                                FLA disagrees with the comments that

                                asserted that these regulations
                                unconstitutionally suppress scientifflc

                                opinion. The regulations address what
                                may appear in labeling; they do not
                                affect any other means of disseminating

                                information. lndeed1 far from limiting
                                the dispersal of scientifflc information1 as

                                stated above1 these regulations1 which
                                implement the 1990 amendments to the

                                act1 permit more information to appear
                                on the label than the act allowed before

                                its amendment.
                                The agency does not agree with the

                                comments: implication that the
                                Constitution requires a more lenient

                                standard of scientifflc validity than that
                                codiffled in y101.14(c). FLA has a strong
                                interest in ensuring that the information

                                that appears on the food label is
                                scientifflcally valid and believes that the

                                standard it has adopted best furthers
                                that interest. When FLA seeys to ensure

                                that food is not misbranded1 it may place
                                restrictions on label contents. See SEC v.

          particular yind of content; (3)
          discriminating against certain speayers

           and forms of communication; and (4)
          denying the constitutional rights of

          willing listeners1 viewers1 and readers.
          FLA disagrees with the comment. The

           agency notes initially that the comment
          misinterprets the scope of the agency:s

           action. These regulations apply only to
          health claims made on the label or in

          labeling of dietary supplements and not
          to advertising.

          The agency disagrees that health claims
           are entitled to full First Amendment

          protection. The agency has stated that1
           although it does not consider it necessary

          for its First Amendment analysis to
          determine whether or not food labeling

          fflts the defflnition of commercial speech1
          labeling should certainly be considered

          closer to commercial speech than to
           44pure:: speech (3W Fh 241W at 2323
          through 2320). lt has also stated that

           44Sl]abeling statements on food products
          intended for sale would clearly appear in

          the context of a commercial transaction
           and would 4propose: such a transaction.::

                                13031 1313 (1993)). The comment does
                                not maye a persuasive argument for

                                considering health claims on dietary
                                supplement labels to be pure speech1 and
                                FLA is not aware of any circumstance in

                                which a court has considered such
                                information on the food label to be

                                comment:s assertion1 information that is

                                Although the agency disagrees that
                                health claims should be considered

                                noncommercial speech1 and although
                                many of the cases cited in the comment
                                deal with fully protected speech rather

                                than commercial speech and thus do not
                                provide a useful analytical framewory for

                                these regulations1 the agency will address
                                the comment:s arguments individually.

                                The agency disagrees that its action

                                denies speayers channels of
                                communication. As discussed above1 the
                                agency has placed no limits on the

                                dissemination of scientifflc information
                                but has acted to permit certain

                                information to appear on the label or in
                                labeling of dietary supplements.

                                Adequate alternative channels remain for
                                the dissemination of scientifflc

                                information. For example1 regulation of
                                the information that may appear on the

                                food label in no way affects the ability of
                                a scientist to publish experimental results
                                .
                                ln a dournal. Moreover1 any interested
                                person may petition for a health claim

                                regulation.
                                The agency disagrees that these

                                regulations should be subdected to the





           close scrutiny afforded restraints on the
           content of pure speech. Of the cases

           cited by the comment to advance this
           argument1 one is particularly instructive.

           ln Turner broadcasting System1 lnc. v.
           FCC 1 the court declined to apply strict

           scrutiny to the 44must-carry:: provisions
           of the 1992 Cable Act1 applying instead

           the 44interest-balancing traditionally
           applied to content-neutral speech

           regulation or legislation ostensibly
           unrelated to expression that is discovered
           to impose incidental burdens on speech.::

           W19 F. Supp. 321 39 (L.L.C. 1993)1 prob.
          duris. noted 1 114 S. Ct. 3W (1993). ln

           passing the Cable Act1 44Congress
           employed its regulatory powers over the

           economy to impose order upon a maryet
          in dysfunction1 but a maryet in a

           commercial commodity nevertheless; not
           a maryet in speech:: ( ld . at 4O).

           Similarly1 with the 1990 amendments
           Congress sought to bring order to the

          food maryet. (See1 e.g.1 130
           Congressional hecord S10011 (October
           241 1990) (statement of Sen. Natch) (44lt

           (44ST]he bill will once and for all settle the
           confusion surrounding health claims.::)).

           As discussed in the fflnal rule on health
           claims for foods in conventional food

          form1 the case law establishes that FLA:s
           power to regulate the food label derives
          from its broad regulatory powers over

          food (3W Fh 2323). As in Turner 1 these
           regulations are valid under the limited

           scrutiny that has been afforded
           restrictions on speech under extensive

           regulatory schemes involving areas of
           economic activity ( ld ).

           The comment argued that the regulations

           are impermissibly discriminatory because
           they require government regulators to

           exercise dudgment based on subdective
          line-drawing1 guided not by rational
           principles of law and science but by the

           will of the censorship authority. FLA
           disagrees. The agency has carefully

           articulated the appropriate scientifflc
           standard that it will apply to proposed

           health claims. Unliye the ordinance at

                                not require an explanation (ld). FLA:s

                                has no interest in regulating the
                                dissemination of scientifflc information in

                                the popular media and has no authority
                                to do so. hather1 its strong interest is in

                                ensuring that health claims made in
                                labeling1 on which consumers are liyely

                                to rely when maying purchasing
                                decisions1 are truthful1 not misleading1

                                 and scientifflcally valid. The agency:s
                                 action contrasts with the categorical ban

                                on commercial newsracys strucy down in

                                 Cincinnati:s interest in safety and

                                esthetics1 overemphasiked the distinction
                                between commercial and noncommercial

                                speech by prohibiting only newsracys
                                holding commercial handbills and not

                                those holding ordinary newspapers ( ld ..
                                 at 1314). The clty thus discriminated

                                 against a use of newsracys that was no
                                more harmful to safety and esthetics

                                than the use it permitted (ld. at 1311).
                                 On the other hand1 FLA:s regulation of

                                health claims in labeling bears a specifflc
                                relationship to the interests the agency

                                has asserted1 because it is directed
                                specifflcally at ensuring the reliability and

                                validity of these claims (see id . at 1314.)
                                 Contrary to the comment:s assertion1 the





           limited scope of FLA:s regulations i.e.1

           food labeling     does not amount to
           discrimination.

           Finally1 the agency disagrees that its
           regulations deny the constitutional rights

           of willing listeners1 viewers1 and readers.
           First1 this argument overstates the

           impact of these regulations1 which will
           affect only the labeling of dietary

           supplements and not other sources of
           information about these products.

           Second1 these regulations will actually
           advance consumers: First Amendment

           interest in obtaining information on
           which to base a purchasing decision1 44by

           insuring that the information is not false
           or deceptive:: ( National Commission on

           U.S. W21 (191W)). 44The fact that health

           is involved enhances the interests of both
           consumers and the public in being

           assured 4that the stream of commercial
           information fflow clearly as well as freely:: :

           3. Commercial Speech

           3lb. Two comments asserted that1 if

           health claims on labels are considered
           commercial speech1 FLA:s regulations

           violate the First Amendment because
           they are more restrictive than necessary
           to achieve the government:s goals. One

           comment recogniked that FLA has 44a
           great interest in preventing false and

           misleading claims and in preventing fraud
           in the maryetplacel:: but argued that

           closing the door on truthful1 qualiffled
           claims that are based on signifflcant

           scientifflc evidence is not reasonably
           responsive to those interests. The other

           comment asserted that the wholesale
           suppression of truthful1 nonmisleading

           speech carries with it the silencing of
           speech indispensable to the health of the

           American people1 and that the agency:s
           action not only lacys a rational

           relationship to the end chosen1 public
           health1 but actually undercuts that goal

           by shrouding the public in ignorance.
           FLA disagrees that these regulations1 if





                                considered under the commercial speech

                                doctrine1 are unconstitutional. The fflnal

                                The comments do not dispute the
                                government:s substantial interest in

                                promoting public health by ensuring that

                                hather1 the comments focus on the last
                                two parts of the Central Nudson test:

                                whether the regulations directly advance
                                the governmental interest1 and whether

                                there is a reasonable fflt between
                                regulatory ends and means.

                                FLA disagrees that its regulations will
                                undercut its stated goals. hather1 the

                                regulations directly advance the
                                governmental interest. The regulations

                                provide for FLA review of the relevant
                                scientifflc evidence on a proposed health

                                claim before the agency decides whether
                                to authorike use of the claim. ln this way1

                                the regulations ensure that health claims
                                are scientifflcally valid and reliable1 and

                                that they will not mislead consumers. At
                                the same time1 the regulatory scheme

                                encourages the provision of information
                                to consumers that will enable them to

                                maintain healthful dietary practices.
                                Thus1 these regulations advance the
                                government:s interest in a 44direct and

           FLA also disagrees that these regulations
           are more extensive than necessary to

           serve the government interest. hecently1
           the Supreme Court stated that the

           44commercial speech cases require a fflt

           Edge 1 the Court upheld a federal statute

           advertising by a broadcaster licensed to a

           State that does not allow lotteries.
           Although the law prevented a

           broadcaster in North Carolina1 with a
           madority of its listeners in Virginia1 from

           airing nonmisleading advertisements for

           of accommodating the policies of both
           lottery and nonlottery States1 not by the

           extent to which it furthers the

           After considering alternate approaches1
           the agency has concluded that the

           procedures and scientifflc standard set out
           in these regulations best advance its

           stated interests under the act. (See
           discussion supra .) As in Edge 1 the
           government has weighed competing

           interests: the interest in maying
           information available on the dietary

           supplement label and in its labeling
           about the relationship between

           nutritional substances and disease or





                                 health-related conditions1 and the

                                 interest in ensuring that the information
                                 provided is scientifflcally valid1

                                 informative1 and not misleading. As in

                                 to protect its interest by applying a

                                 3lc. One comment asserted that an
                                 overbroad suppression of scientifflc speech

                                 on communications media used by
                                 manufacturers creates a pervasive chilling

                                 effect on their willingness (and that of
                                 the scientists they employ) to

                                 communicate their fflndings for public
                                 and professional consideration.

                                 The overbreadth doctrine is an exception
                                 to traditional rules of standing and is

                                 applicable in First Amendment cases in
                                 order to ensure that an overbroad statute

                                 does not chill the exercise of protected

           FLA disagrees that these regulations are
           overbroad or that they will chill free

           speech. The activity prohibited under
           the act and these regulations         maryeting

           dietary supplements bearing unapproved
           health claims in their
          labeling     constitutes a 44core of easily

          identifflable and constitutionally
           proscribable conductl:: (401 U.S. at

           903-900). Labeling is defflned in the act
           and easily identifflable. See 21 U.S.C.

           321(m) (44The term labeling means all

           the regulations are narrowly tailored to

           accomplish the government:s goals.
           ln any event1 it is doubtful that the

           overbreadth doctrine would apply to
           these regulations1 particularly if they are

           considered to regulate commercial
           speech1 because the overbreadth doctrine
           does not apply to commercial speech.

           32. One comment asserted that the

           tayings clause of the United States
           Constitution provides protection to
           dietary supplement trade names. lt

           argued that y101.14 might proscribe
           certain trade names that FLA has
                              .
           allowed to remaln on the maryet for
           years. The comment urged FLA to give

           more attention1 under Executive Order





                                120301 to the regulation:s possible
                                tayings implications.

                                When it issued its fflnal regulations
                                governing conventional foods under the

                                1990 amendments1 FLA fully discussed
                                the tayings implications of those

                                regulations. (See 3W Fh at 2391 through
                                2400 and 232W through 2329). This

                                discussion1 including the underlying
                                tayings analysls1 is incorporated herein..

                                The agency concluded that there would
                                be no regulatory taying under the Fifth

                                Amendment if a manufacturer is required

                                name asserts by implication a
                                relationship between the presence or level
                                of a substance in the food and a disease

                                or health-related condition1 and that
                                relationship ls not the subdect of an.

                                approved health claim (3W Fh at 2329).
                                because the agency conducted its

                                analysis before passage of the LS act1 it
                                fully tooy into account the regulations:

                                impact on dietary supplements.
                                Although the comment stated that FLA

                                must address the issues raised by its
                                regulations in light of Executive Order

                                120301 it did not provide any additional
                                information that the agency has not
                                already considered. Therefore1 the

                                agency concludes that it is not necessary
                                to address potential tayings issues in any

                                greater detail.

                                33. A few comments obdected to the
                                period of time provided for public

                                comment on the proposal1 stating that it
                                was too short. One of these comments

                                asserted that FLA had no reason to
                                establish such a short deadline other than

                                to curtail public input on the proposed
                                regulations. Another of these comments

                                requested that FLA extend the period
                                for public comment on the proposed

                                regulations to give consumer advocacy
                                groups1 health care professionals1 and the

                                scientifflc community adequate time to
                                prepare the information and opinions
                                needed to fairly resolve the issues

                                associated with the proposal.

                                As explained in the preamble of the
                                proposals1 the LS act requires that fflnal
                                rules implementing the 1990 amendments

                                with respect to dietary supplements be





          issued by Lecember 311 1993. To meet
          this statutory timeframe1 FLA was

          forced to limit the comment period for
          the proposed regulations to 00 days.
          Thus1 the agency reaMrms that it is

          unable to grant any extensions to the
          comment period.

          34. One comment requested that FLA
          clarify that the compliance date is the

          date on which manufacturers of dietary
          supplements must begin to label

          products in accordance with y101.14.
          FLA advises that the comment is

          correct. Section 1O(a)(2) of the 1990
          amendments specifflcally states that 44t t
          t section 403(r) of the Federal Food1

          Lrug1 and Cosmetic Act t t t shall not
          apply to food which was labeled before

          the effective date of the amendments t t
          t Semphasis added].:: Accordingly1 the

          effective date of the health claims
          regulations for dietary supplements
          adopted by the agency under section

          403(r) refers to the date on which a
          dietary supplement is labeled.

          33. A number of comments concerned
          the requirement in y101.14(d)(2)(iv) that

          states that all claims must appear in one
          place1 in the same type sike1 without

          intervening material. The comments
          addressed the exception in this provision
          that a short reference statement may

          appear on the label1 44See
          for information about the relationship

          between                     and
                           1:: with the blanys ffllled in

          with references to the location of the
          labeling on which the full claim appears1
          the name of the substance1 and the

          disease or health-related condition. The
          comment requested that FLA allow

          graphic material constituting an implied
          health claim to appear on the pLp

          without the accompanying referral
          statement or full health claim1 as long as
          the graphic material appeared in

          condunction with the full health claim
          elsewhere on the labeling. The comment

          dustiffled this request based on the lacy of
          suMcient label space on the pLp for the

          referral statement.
          FLA does not believe that it should

          maye the requested revision in
          y101.14(d)(2)(iv). ln situations where





                                graphic material constitutes an implied
                                health claim1 and the reference statement
                                .
                                ls not present1 the graphic material on
                                the labeling is in fact a shortened form of

                                the health claim. FLA explained in
                                response to comment 09 in the health

                                claims fflnal rule that shortened health
                                claims are misleading because they do

                                not include facts that are material in
                                light of the representation that is made
                                and that are necessary to understand the

                                claim in the context of the daily diet.

                                A. Economic lmpact

                                ln its dietary supplement labeling
                                proposals pertaining to health claims1

                                nutrition labeling1 and nutrient content
                                claims in the 'une 1W1 1993 Federal
                                hegister (3W Fh 331001 331131 and

                                33131)1 FLA stated that the proposed
                                rules on the labeling of dietary

                                supplements1 tayen as a whole1 would
                                have associated costs of approximately

                                t20 million. Thus1 the agency concluded
                                that the proposed rules do not constitute

                                a mador rule as defflned by Executive
                                Order 12291. ln accordance with the

                                hegulatory Flexibility Act (pub. L.
                                9O-334)1 FLA explored whether the
                                proposed rules may have a signifflcant

                                impact on small businesses and
                                tentatively concluded that they do not.

                                FLA has evaluated many comments that
                                lt received in response to its economic.
                                                .

                                raised in the comments relate to all three

                                proposals1 FLA has combined its
                                discussion of these comments and

                                presented them in the fflnal rule regarding
                                the establishment of the date of

                                application published elsewhere in this
                                issue of the Federal hegister .

                                FLA has examined the economic
                                implications of the fflnal rules as required
                                by Executive Order 12W00 and the

                                hegulatory Flexibility Act (pub. L.
                                9O-334). Executive Order 12W00 directs

                                agencies to assess all costs and benefflts of
                                available regulatory alternatives and1

                                when regulation is necessary1 to select
                                regulatory approaches that maximike net

                                environmental1 and public health and

              .
          equlty). The hegulatory Flexibility Act
          requires that the agency analyke the

          options for regulatory relief for small
          businesses. FLA has concluded1 based on

          its review of the available data and
          comments1 that these fflnal rules are not

          signifflcant as that term is defflned by
          Executive Order 12W00. Further1 in
          accordance with the hegulatory

          Flexibility Act1 the agency certiffles that
          these fflnal rules will not have a

          signifflcant impact on a substantial
          number of small businesses.

          b. Environmental lmpact
          The agency has previously considered the

          environmental effects of this rule when it
          was part of the proposed rule pertaining

          to both foods in conventional food form
          and dietary supplements (November 211

          1991 Federal hegister (30 Fh 00331 at
          00302)). At that time1 FLA determined
          under y23.24(a)(W) and (11) that the

          proposed action was of a type that does
          not individually or cumulatively have a

          signifflcant impact on the human
          environment. No new information or

          comments have been received with
          respect to health claims for dietary

          supplements that would affect the
          agency:s previous determination that
          there is no signifflcant impact on the

          human environment1 and that an
          environmental impact statement is not

          required.
          C. paperwory heduction Act

          ln the dietary supplement proposal of
          'une 1W1 1993 (3W Fh 33100 at 33114)1

          FLA announced that the agency had
          submitted to the OMce of Management

          and budget (OMb) for its review the
          collection of information requirements

          contained in proposed y101.101 for
          petitions regarding the use of health
          claims in condunction with food labeling

          on dietary supplements. Also in that
          document1 FLA published its estimated

          annual collection of information burden
          for this provision.

          None of the more than 11200 comments
          received in response to the dietary

          supplement proposal addressed the
          content of petitions under the proposed

          health claim petition requirements.
          Thus1 the agency:s estimate of the





                               annual reporting and recordyeeping
                               burden from the health claim petition
                               requirements contained in this fflnal rule

                               remains unchanged from the estimate
                               that it announced in 'une 1993.

                               FLA has submitted copies of the fflnal
                               rule to OMb for its review of these

                               reporting requirements.

                                The 1990 amendments to the Federal

                                Food1 Lrug1 and Cosmetic Act (the act)
                                (pub. L. 101-333) gave the Secretary of

                                Secretary)1 and by delegation FLA1 the
                                authority to issue regulations authoriking
                                health claims on the labels and in the

                                labeling of foods. Section 403(r)(l)(b) of
                                the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(l)(b)) provides

                                that a product is misbranded if it bears a
                                claim that characterikes the relationship
                                of a nutrient to a disease or

                                health-related condition1 unless the claim
                                ls made in accordance with procedures.

                                and standards established under section

                                U.S.C. 343(r)(3) and (r)(3)(L)).

                                The 1990 amendments also directed the
                                Secretary to determine through

                                requirements of the act. The relationship

                                of folic acid and NTL:s was among those
                                10 topics (section 3(b)(l)(A)(x) of the
                                1990 amendments).

                                Activities helated To Folate and Ntd:s

                                A. The 1991 proposed hule
                                ln the Federal hegister of November 211

                                1991 (30 Fh 00331)1 FLA proposed to
                                not authorike a health claim on folic acid
                                and NTL:s. The agency tentatively

                                concluded that the available evidence did
                                not establish that the standard that FLA
                                had proposed for health claims for

                                dietary supplements under section
                                403(r)(3)(L) of the act was met1 that is1

                                that there was not signifflcant scientifflc
                                agreement1 based on the totality of
                                publicly available scientifflc evidence1 that

                                the claim is valid.
                                b. The public Nealth Service





          hecommendations
          ln September 19921 the public Nealth

          Service (pNS) issued a recommendation
          that all women of childbearing age in the

          United States who are capable of
          becoming pregnant should consume 0.4
          milligram (mg) of folic acid)day for the

          purpose of reducing their risy of having a
          pregnancy affected with spina bifflda or

          other NTL:s. The recommendation was
          based on data suggesting that folic acid1

          when given at a high dose (4 mg)1 can
          reduce the risy of recurrence of NTL:s
          and on a synthesis of information from

          studies that used multivitamins
          containing folic acid at dose levels from 0

          to 11000 micrograms)day. The pNS
          recommendation identiffled approaches

          and identiffled outstanding issues1
          including the appropriate intaye of folate1
          the potential role of other nutrients in

          reduction of risy of NTL:s1 safety
          concerns1 and the 44folate-preventable::

          fraction of NTL:s.
          C. The Lietary Supplement Act of 1992

          ln October 19921 the LS act was
          enacted. This statute imposed a

          moratorium on FLA:s implementation of
          the 1990 amendments with respect to

          dietary supplements until Lecember 131
          1993. The LS act directed FLA to issue
          proposed rules to implement the 1990

          amendments with respect to dietary
          supplements by 'une 131 19931 and to

          issue fflnal rules based on these proposals
          by Lecember 311 1993. The LS act also
          amended the so-called 44hammer::

          provision of the 1990 amendments1
          section 3(b)(2) of the 1990 amendments1

          to provide that if the agency did not
          meet the established Lecember 311 19931

          timeframe for issuance of fflnal rules1 the
          proposed regulations would be considered

          fflnal regulations.
          L. The 1993 Final hules for Nealth

          Claims for Foods in Conventional Food
          Form

          On 'anuary 01 1993 (3W Fh 2000)1 FLA
          published a fflnal rule to not authorike a
          health claim for folic acid and NTL:s.

          Nowever1 the agency reaMrmed its
          support of the pNS recommendation

          that all women of childbearing age in the
          United States who are capable of





                               becoming pregnant should consume 0.4
                               mg of folic acid daily to reduce their risy
                               of having a pregnancy affected with spina

                               bifflda or other NTL:s. The agency
                               noted1 however1 that unresolved

                               questions about the safe use of folate
                               remained. The agency concluded that it
                               could not authorike a health claim until

                               these questions were resolved. because of
                               the LS act1 FLA tooy no fflnal action

                               with respect to the use of a health claim
                               on folic acid and NTL:s on dietary
                               supplements.

                               E. The 1993 proposal to Authorike a
                               Nealth Claim on Folic Acid and NTL:s

                               On October 141 19931 FLA published a
                               proposed rule to authorike the use of a
                               health claim about the relationship of

                               folate and NTL:s on the labels of foods

           y101.19 Nealth claims: folate and neural
          tube defects.

           (a) helationship between folate and
          neural tube defects        (l) Lefflnition .

          Neural tube defects are serious birth
          defects of the brain or spinal cord that

          can result in infant mortality or serious
          disability. The birth defects anencephaly

          and spina bifflda are the most common
          forms of neural tube defects and account

          for about 90 percent of these defects.
          These defects result from failure of

          closure of the covering of the brain or
          spinal cord during early embryonic
          development. because the neural tube

          forms and closes during early pregnancy1
          the defect may occur before a woman

          realikes that she is pregnant.
           (2) helationship . The available data

          show that diets adequate in folate may
          reduce the risy of neural tube defects.

          The strongest evidence for this
          relationship comes from an intervention

          study by the Medical hesearch Council
          of the United Kingdom that showed that

          women at risy of recurrence of a neural
          tube defect pregnancy who consumed a

          supplement containing 4 milligrams (mg)
           (41000 micrograms (pg)) folic acid daily
          had a reduced risy of having a child with

          a neural tube defect. (products that
          contain this level of folic acid are drugs.)

          ln addition1 based on its review of a
          Nungarian intervention trial that used a

          multivitamin and multimineral
          preparation containing W00 pg (0.W mg)

          of folic acid1 and its review of the
          observational studies that reported use of
          multivitamins containing 0 to 11000 pg of

          folic acid1 the Food and Lrug
          Administration concluded that most of

          these studies had results consistent with
          the conclusion that folate1 at levels

          attainable in usual diets1 may reduce the
          risy of neural tube defects.

           (b) Signifflcance of folate      (l) public
          health concern . Neural tube defects

          occur in approximately 0.0 of 11000 live
          births in the United States (i.e.1 about

          21300 cases among 4 million live births
          annually). Neural tube defects are

          believed to be caused by many factors..
          The slngle greatest risy factor for a
          neural tube defect-affected pregnancy ls       .





                                a personal or family history of a
                                pregnancy affected with a such a defect.

                                Nowever1 about 90 percent of infants
                                with a neural tube defect are born to

                                women who do not have a family history
                                of these defects. The available evidence

                                shows that diets adequate in folate may
                                reduce the risy of neural tube defects but

                                not of other birth defects.

                                defects vary within the United States1
                                with lower rates observed on the west

                                about 11230) may be averted annually if

                                all women consume adequate amounts of
                                folate daily (i.e.1 0.4 mg) throughout

                                 standards1 the folate in the dietary

                                 supplement shall be shown to be
                                 bioavailable under the conditions of use

                                 stated on the product label.
                                 (iii) Limitation . The claim shall not be





          made on foods in conventional food form
          or dietary supplements that contain more

          than 100 percent of the hLl for vitamin
          A as retinol or preformed vitamin A or

          vitamin L.
           (iv) Nutrition labeling . The nutrition

          label shall include information about the
          amount of folate in the food. This

          information shall be declared after the
          declaration for iron if only the levels of

          vitamin A1 vitamin C1 calcium1 and iron
          are provided1 or in accordance with

           y101.9(c)(W) and (c)(9) if other optional
          vitamins or minerals are declared.
           (3) Optional information          .
                                            (l) hisy
          factors . The claim may specifflcally
          identify risy factors for neural tube

          defects;
           (ii) helationship between folate and

          neural tube defects . The claim may
          include statements from paragraphs (a)

          and (b) of this section that summarike
          the relationship between folate and

          neural tube defects and the signifflcance
          of the relationship except for information

          specifflcally prohibited from the claim.
           (iii) personal history of a neural tube
          defect-affected pregnancy . The claim

          may state that women with a history of a
          neural tube defect pregnancy should

          consult their physicians or health care
          providers before becoming pregnant.

           (iv) Laily value . The claim may identify
          the daily value level of 400 pg of folate

          per day as the target intaye goal.
           (d) Model health claims . The followlng     .

          are examples of model health claims that
          may be used in food labeling to describe

          the relationship between folate and
          neural tube defects:

           (l) Example 1 . Women who consume
          adequate amounts of folate1 a b vitamin1

          daily throughout their childbearing years
          may reduce their risy of having a child
          with a neural tube birth defect. Such

          birth defects1 while not widespread1 are
          very serious. They can have many

          causes. Adequate amounts of folate can
          be obtained from diets rich in fruits1 dary

          green leafy vegetables and legumes1
          enriched grain products1 fortiffled cereals1

          or a supplement. Folate consumption
          should be limited to 11000 pg per day

          from all sources.





                                (2) Example 2 . Women who consume

                                adequate amounts of folate daily
                                throughout their childbearing years may
                                reduce their risy of having a child with a

                                birth defect of the brain and spinal cord.
                                Such birth defects1 while not widespread1

                                are very serious. They can have many
                                causes. Adequate amounts of folate1 a b

                                vitamin1 can be obtained from diets rich
                                ln fruits1 dary green leafy vegetables and.

                                legumes1 enriched grain products1
                                fortiffled cereals1 or a supplement.

                                Women who have had a child with a
                                spinal cord birth defect should consult a

                                physician before becoming pregnant.
                                Folate consumption should be limited to

                                11000 pg per day from all sources.
                                (3) Example 3 . Women who taye steps

                                to ensure that their folate intaye is
                                adequate throughout their childbearing

                                years may reduce their risy of having a
                                child with a neural tube defect. Such

                                birth defects1 while not widespread1 are
                                very serious. They can have many

                                causes. Adequate amounts of folate1 a b
                                vitamin1 can be obtained from diets rich
                                .
                                ln citrus fruits and duices1 dary green
                                leafy vegetables and legumes1 enriched

                                grain products such as breads1 rice1 and
                                pasta1 fortiffled cereal1 or a supplement.
                                Folate consumption should be limited to

                                11000 pg per day from all sources.

                                (4) Example 4 . Women who taye steps
                                to ensure that their folate intaye is at

                                least 400 pg daily throughout their
                                childbearing years may reduce their risy
                                of having a child with spina bifflda or

                                anencephaly1 birth defects of the brain or
                                spinal cord that1 while not widespread1

                                are very serious. These birth defects can
                                have many causes. Adequate amounts of

                                folate1 a b vitamin1 can be obtained from
                                diets rich in fruits1 including citrus fruits

                                and duices1 vegetables1 including dary
                                green leafy vegetables and legumes1

                                enriched grain products1 including
                                breads1 rice1 and pasta1 fortiffled cereals1

                                or from a supplement. Women who have
                                had a pregnancy affected with a neural

                                tube defect should consult a physician
                                before becoming pregnant. Folate

                                consumption should be limited to 11000
                                pg per day from all sources.

                                (3) Example 3 . Some women who





          consume the Laily Value of folate (400
          pg) throughout their childbearing years

          may reduce their risy of having a child
          affected with spina bifflda or anencephaly1

          birth defects of the brain or spinal cord
          that1 while not widespread1 are very

          serious. These birth defects can have
          many causes. Women of childbearing age

          should choose well-balanced diets that
          include 2 to 4 servings per day of fruits

           (including citrus fruits and duices)1 3 to 3
          servings of vegetables (including dary

          green leafy vegetables and legumes)1 0 to
           11 servings of enriched grain products

           (such as breads1 rice1 and pasta) or
          fortiffled cereals throughout their
          childbearing years. Such diets provide

          many essential minerals and vitamins1
          including folate. Women who may be

          concerned about their diets may choose
          to obtain folate from a supplement.

          Folate consumption should be limited to
           11000 pg per day from all sources.

           (e) Effective date . For fortiffled foods1
          this regulation is effective on the date the

          food additive regulation on the use of
          folic acid that was proposed on October

           141 19931 becomes effective.
          The 1990 amendments state that FLA is

          to promptly publish notice of the new
          status of the proposed regulations in the

          Federal hegister . This notice is issued in
          response to that requirement. The

          agency emphasikes1 however1 that this
          regulation is deemed to be a fflnal

          regulation only with respect to dietary
          supplements.

          The agency notes that this document is
          part of a separate rulemaying

          contemplated by Congress if the fflnal
          regulation was not issued by Lecember
          311 1993. This rulemaying bears a

          separate docyet number from the one
          assigned to the October 141 1993

          rulemaying to distinguish it from that
          rulemaying1 which is ongolng. The.

          agency intends to continue its
          rulemaying with respect to folic acid and

          neural tube defects and to issue a fflnal
          rule as quicyly as possible.

          ln this regard1 FLA recognikes that
          clarifflcation with respect to the legal

          status of claims about folic acid and
          NTL:s on foods in conventional food





                                form is appropriate. FLA advises that1

                                given the pNS recommendation and the
                                results of FLA:s preliminary review of
                                the evidence on this claim1 at this time it

                                has no intention of taying action against
                                foods in conventional food form that are

                                naturally high in folate that bear a claim
                                on this nutrient-disease relationship1 so

                                long as the claim fully complies with the
                                provisions of the regulation that has

                                become fflnal for dietary supplements by
                                operation of law.

                                Nowever1 for foods fortiffled with folic
                                acid1 the agency has more signifflcant

                                concerns. As explained in the health
                                claim proposal on folic acid and NTL:s

                                (3W Fh 33234 at 332WW) and the proposal
                                to amend the food additive regulation on

                                folic acid that published in the Federal
                                hegister on October 141 1993 (3W Fh
                                33312)1 there appears to be a rather

                                narrow range of safe use of folic acid in
                                food. based on this tentative view1 FLA

                                would be very concerned1 at least until it
                                reached a fflnal determination in those

                                proceedings1 if manufacturers began
                                adding folic acid to their products1 or

                                increasing the amount of folic acid in
                                their products1 to qualify for a claim.

                                Therefore1 FLA strongly discourages the
                                use of a health claim about folic acid and

                                NTL:s on any such fortiffled products
                                pending the issuance of a fflnal rule on

                                this nutrient-disease relationship.
                                As stated above1 FLA intends to issue a

                                fflnal rule in the proceeding on a health
                                claim on folic acid and NTL:s that it
                                began on October 141 19931 in the near

                                future. FLA is in the process of
                                evaluating the comments that it has

                                received in that proceeding1 including the
                                results of an advisory committee meeting

                                held on October 14 and 13. FLA will
                                attempt to resolve the issues in that
                                      .
                                ongolng proceeding as soon as possible.

                               ll. passage of 1990 Amendments

                               The 1990 amendments to the Federal
                               Food1 Lrug1 and Cosmetic Act (the act)

                               gave the Secretary of Nealth and Numan
                               Services (the Secretary)1 and by
                               delegation FLA1 the authority to issue

                               regulations authoriking health claims on
                               the labels and in the labeling of foods.

                               Section 403(r)(l)(b) of the act (21
                               U.S.C. 343(r)(l)(b)) provides that a
                               product is misbranded if it bears a claim

                               that characterikes the relationship of a
                               nutrient to a disease or health-related
                               condition1 unless the claim is made in

                               accordance with procedures and
                               standards established under section

                               403(r)(3) and (r)(3)(L) of the act (21
                               U.S.C. 343(r)(3) and (r)(3)(L)).

                               The 1990 amendments also directed the
                               Secretary to determine through
                               rulemaying whether claims regarding 10

                               nutrient-disease relationships meet the
                               requirements of the act. Lietary fflber

                               and (b)(l)(A)(x) of the 1990
                               amendments. lll. The 1991 Nealth

                               Claims proposals
                               ln the Federal hegister of November 211
                                19911 FLA proposed not to authorike

                               health claims on dietary fflber and CVL
                                (30 Fh 003W2); dietary fflber and cancer

                                (30 Fh 00300); antioxidant vitamins and
                               cancer (30 Fh 00024); kinc and immune
                               function in the elderly (30 Fh 00032);

                               and omega-3 fatty acids and CNL (30
                               Fh 00003). The agency tentatively
                               concluded that the available evidence did

                               not establish that the standard that FLA
                               had proposed for health claims for





          dietary supplements under section
          403(r)(3)(L) of the act was met1 that is1

          the agency tentatively concluded that
          there was not signifflcant scientifflc
          agreement1 based on the totality of

          publicly available scientifflc evidence that
          these claims are valid.

          lV. The Lietary Supplement Act of 1992
          ln October 19921 the LS act was

          enacted. This statute imposed a
          moratorium on FLA:s implementation of

          the 1990 amendments with respect to
          dietary supplements until Lecember 131
          1993 (although the LS act did provide

          that FLA could authorike claims for
          dietary supplements before that date).

          The LS act directed FLA to issue
          proposed rules to implement the 1990

          amendments with respect to dietary
          supplements by 'une 131 19931 and to
          issue fflnal rules based on these proposals

          by Lecember 311 1993. The LS act also
          amended the so-called 44hammer::

          provision of the 1990 amendments1
          section 3(b)(2) of the 1990 amendments1

          to provide that if the agency did not
          meet the established Lecember 311 19931
          timeframe for issuance of fflnal rules1 the

          proposed regulations would be considered
          fflnal regulations.

          V. The 1993 Final hules For Nealth
          Claims For Foods in Conventional Food

          Form
          On 'anuary 01 19931 FLA published fflnal

          rules on the general requirements for
          health claims on the labels and in the
          labeling of foods in conventional food

          form (3W Fh 241W)1 and fflnal rules
          authoriking health claims on seven

          nutrient-disease relationships (calcium
          and osteoporosis; fat and cancer;

          saturated fat and cholesterol and CNL;
          fflber-containing grain products1 fruits1
          and vegetables and cancer; fruits1

          vegetables1 and grain products that
          contain fflber and risy of CNL; and fruits

          and vegetables and cancer). Three of the
          health claims that FLA authoriked were

          for fresh fruits and vegetables and grains1
          and thus these claims were not
          authoriked for dietary supplements.

          because of the LS act1 FLA tooy no
          fflnal action with respect to the use on

          dietary supplements of health claims on





                               dietary fflber and cancer; dietary fflber
                               and CVL; omega-3 fatty acids and CNL;

                               kinc and immune function in the elderly;
                               and antioxidant vitamins and cancer.

                                (The agency:s actions with respect to
                               health claims involving folic acid and

                               Vl. The 1993 proposal to Not Authorike

                               Nealth Claims For Lietary Supplements
                               On October 141 19931 FLA published a

                               proposal to not authorike health claims
                               on the labels of dietary supplements on

                               fflve nutrient-disease relationships:
                               Lietary fflber and cancer; dietary fflber
                               and CVL; antioxidant vitamins and

                               cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CNL;
                               and kinc and immune function in the

                               elderly (3W Fh 33290). FLA provided 00
                               days for comment on this proposed

                               action. Thus1 the comment period closed
                               on Lecember 131 1993.

                               Section 3(b)(2) of the 1990 amendments1
                               as amended by section 202(a)(2)(b)(ii) of

                               the LS act1 provides that if the Secretary
                               does not promulgate fflnal regulations on

                               any of the health claims applicable to
                               dietary supplements in a timely manner1
                               the proposed regulations shall be

                               considered fflnal regulations but not until
                               after Lecember 311 1993. FLA did not

                               issue fflnal regulations on the use of
                               health claims on dietary supplements on

                               dietary fflber and cancer; dietary fflber
                               and CVL; antioxidant vitamins and

                               cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CNL;
                               and kinc and immune function in the

                               elderly by Lecember 311 1993. Therefore1
                               FLA is issuing this document
                               announcing that by operation of law1 the

                               change in its regulations that FLA
                               proposed to refflect a decision not to

                               authorike health claims about the
                               relationships of dietary fflber and cancer;

                               dietary fflber and CVL; antioxidant

                                141 19931 Federal hegister 1 ls now
                               considered a fflnal regulation by operation
                               of law. The agency proposed that 21

                               CFh part 101 be amended as follows:
                               pAhT 101 FOOL LAbELlNO





          2. Section 101.11 is amended by revising

          the introductory text to read as follows:
          y101.11 Nealth claims: claims not

          authoriked.
          Nealth claims not authoriked for foods in

          conventional food form or for dietary
          supplements of vitamins1 minerals1 herbs1

          or other similar substances:
          t t t t t

          The 1990 amendments state that FLA is
          to promptly publish notice of the new
          status of the proposed change in its

          regulations in the Federal hegister . This
          notice is issued in response to that

          requirement.
          The agency notes that this rulemaying

          constitutes a separate rulemaying from
          that instituted with respect to the fflve

          nutrient-disease relationships on October
          141 1993. This separate rulemaying was

          contemplated by Congress if a fflnal rule
          was not issued by Lecember 311 1993.

          The agency notes1 however1 that the
          October 141 19931 rulemaying remains
                .

          ln particular1 with regard to antioxidant

          vitamins and cancer1 on November 1
          through 31 19931 FLA held a public

          conference on this nutrient-disease
          relationship. (The conference also

          covered antioxidant vitamins and CVL.)
          The transcript of that meeting has been

          submitted to the Locyet as a comment1
          and other comments were solicited in the

          announcement of the conference (3W Fh
          343931 October 221 1993). FLA intends

          to consider all comments and data
          received at this conference. FLA intends

          to taye any actions that it concludes are
          warranted by this information either in
          the ongolng rulemaying on an.

          ACTlON: Final rule.

          SUMMAhy: NMFS has determined that
          the Sacramento hiver winter-run chinooy

          salmon should be reclassiffled from
          threatened to endangered under the

          Endangered Species Act of 1913 (ESA).
          NMFS has determined that the current

          biological status of the species is
          endangered based on the continued
          decline and increased variability of run

          sikes since its fflrst listing as a threatened
          species in 19W91 the expectation of weay

          returns in certain years as the result of
          two small year classes (1991 and 1993)1

          and continuing threats to the population.
          Although measures implemented through
          consultations conducted under section 1

          of the ESA and State and Federal
          regulatory actions are designed to reduce

          adverse impacts on the species1
          quantifflable improvements in population

          levels are not liyely to be evident for
          several years. NMFS will continue to

          closely monitor the status of this
          population1 and evaluate the protective
          measures to determine whether there is

          evidence that these measures have
          reduced or eliminated threats to the





                               species and whether a change in status
                               may be warranted.

                               based on a review of the status of the

                               salmon and the factors affecting the

                               species1 NMFS has determined that it is
                               endangered.

                               The Sacramento hiver winter-run
                               chinooy salmon is a unique population

                               that is distinguishable from other
                               chinooy salmon runs in the Sacramento

                               hiver based on the timing of its upstream
                               migration and spawning period. For the

                               most part1 the winter-run chinooy
                               salmon population is comprised of three

                               year classes1 each of which primarily
                               returns to spawn as 3-year old fflsh.
                               The best available data on winter-run

                               chinooy salmon abundance are the
                               annual estimates of the spawning run sike

                               made by the California Lepartment of
                               Fish and Oame (CLFO) based on counts

                               of fflsh passing the hed bluff Liversion
                               Lam. The CLFO began estimating the

                               annual run sike for winter-run chinooy
                               salmon in 1901 after the Lam was placed

                               run sike estimates has documented a

                               precipitous decline in the winter-run
                               chinooy salmon to its present low level
                               (Table 1).

          ln 19W91 the CLFO estimated that the

          winter-run chinooy salmon run sike was
          only 341 fflsh. This unexpectedly small

          return represented nearly a 13 percent
          decline from the consistent1 but low1 run
          sike of 21000 to 31000 fflsh that had

          occurred since 19W2. As a result of this
          unexpected decline1 NMFS issued an
          emergency interim rule listing the

          winter-run chinooy salmon as threatened
          under the ESA on August 41 19W9 (34 Fh

          320W3). Luring the period the emergency
          interim rule was in effect1 NMFS
          published a proposed rule to list

          winter-run chinooy salmon as threatened
          under the formal listing procedures of the

          ESA on March 201 1990 (33 Fh 10200).
          To avoid a hiatus in protection of the
          species until the formal listing process

          was completed1 NMFS published a
          second emergency interim rule listing
          winter-run chinooy salmon as threatened

          on April 21 1990 (33 Fh 12191). On
          November 31 19901 NMFS completed the





                                formal listing process and published a
                                fflnal rule (33 Fh 40313) listing the

                                species as threatened under the ESA.
                                On 'une 31 19911 the American Fisheries

                                Society petitioned NMFS to reclassify
                                winter-run chinooy salmon as an

                                endangered species. At the time the
                                petition was submitted1 the best
                                preliminary data available indicated that

                                the 1991 run would consist of a return of
                                only WW to 200 adults from the progeny of

                                the 19WW run of 210W3 fflsh. The fflnal run
                                sike estimate made by the CLFO for

                                1991 was 191 fflsh (Table 1). NMFS
                                reviewed the petition and determined
                                that it contained substantial information

                                indicating that the petitioned action
                                might be warranted. On November 11

                                19911 NMFS announced (30 Fh 3W9WO)
                                its intention to review the status of the

                                species to determine whether
                                reclassifflcation was appropriate. After

                                conducting a status review1 NMFS
                                published a proposed rule (31 Fh 21410)
                                on 'une 191 19921 to reclassify winter-run

                                chinooy salmon as endangered.
                                NMFS published a subsequent Federal

                                hegister notice (3W Fh 310WW) on 'une 41
                                19931 delaying the issuance of a fflnal

                                4(b)(O)(b) of the ESA. On September
                                101 19931 NMFS published another
                                Federal hegister notice that provided

                                information on the 1993 run sike estimate
                                (341 fflsh) and reopened the public

                                comment period on the proposed rule.
                                This determination does not change any

                                of the prohibitions against taying
                                Sacramento hiver winter-run chinooy

                                salmon. Section 9 of the ESA prohibits
                                taying endangered species. The
                                regulations issued when this species was

                                listed as threatened in November 1990
                                also prohibit taying.

                                list to refflect the reclassifflcation of this

                                Conservation measures were implemented

                                by the bureau of heclamation (bureau)





          beginning in 19WO-19W1 in an effort to
          improve adult passage conditions for

          winter-run chinooy salmon at hed bluff
          Liversion Lam and to provide suitable
                  .
          spawnlng and egg incubation conditions
          for the species in the upper Sacramento

          hiver below Keswicy Lam. Lespite the
          implementation of measures in 19WO-19W1

          and 19Wl-19WW1 the winter-run chinooy
          salmon run sike declined to 441 fflsh in

          1990 and to 191 fflsh in 1991. The
          estimated 1991 run sike of 191 fflsh was

          primarily the result of surviving progeny.
          from the 19WW spawnlng population of
                                                  .
          210W3 fflsh. Thus1 the 1991 spawnlng
          escapement represented nearly a 90
          percent decline in a slngle generation1.

          and suggested that the 19WW year class
          was nearly a total failure (31 Fh 21410).

          ln 19921 the CLFO estimated that the

          winter-run chinooy salmon run sike
          increased to 111W0 fflsh. This run sike was

          substantially higher than the runs
          estimated in 19W9 (341 fflsh)1 1990 (441

          fflsh)1 and 1991 (191 fflsh)1 and it
          represented more than a 100 percent
          increase in the spawnlng population in a.
           .
          slngle successive generation since the
          1992 run was comprised primarily of the

          surviving progeny from the 19W9 run. ln
          19W91 the bureau implemented

          conservation measures to manage upper
          Sacramento hiver water temperatures

          and provide improved fflsh passage at the
          hed bluff. As a result of these actions1

          temperature conditions were much
          improved with favorable water

          temperatures occurring from Keswicy
          Lam to bend bridge (44 miles

          downstream) during almost the entire.
          spawnlng and egg incubation period.
                  .
          Spawnlng ground surveys in 19W9 also
          indicated that nearly 100 percent of the
          estimated run spawned in this 44-mile

          river reach where water temperature was
          favorable. As a result of these factors1

          temperature-related mortality was
          minimal in 19W9. The substantial

          increase in the 1992 run sike suggests
          that the measures implemented to

          protect winter-run chinooy salmon in
          19W9 were effective1 and that similar or

          more protective measures may be
          successful in the future.

          ln 19931 the CLFO estimated the

          winter-run chinooy salmon run sike to be
          341 fflsh. This represented nearly a 30

          percent decline of the run sike in one
          generation. NMFS had anticipated that

          the run sike would liyely decline in 1993.
          because the 1990 spawnlng population

          (441 fflsh) experienced less favorable
          water temperature conditions during
                 .
          spawnlng and egg incubation1 and more
          of the run spawned downstream from the

          river reach where temperatures could be
          suitably managed by the bureau. ln
          19901 as a result of continued drought

          conditions and high ambient
          temperatures1 favorable water
                                      .
          temperatures for spawnlng and egg
          incubation were present only from

          Keswicy Lam to the balls Ferry bridge





                                (20 miles downstream) during a portion
                                of the egg incubation period. ln addition1
                                        .
                                spawnlng distribution surveys indicated
                                that nearly 10 percent of the run

                                spawned downstream from balls Ferry
                                where temperatures were not favorable.

                                Therefore1 temperature-related mortality
                                was substantially higher in 1990 than in

                                19W9. ln addition to less favorable
                                temperature conditions1 it is possible

                                that conditions for outmigrants were less
                                than favorable1 and that ocean survival
                                of the 1990 year class was reduced by the

                                El Nino event that began in 1991-92.
                                Since the winter-run chinooy salmon was

                                formally listed as threatened in
                                November 1990 (33 Fh 40313)1 the

                                Although some protective measures were

                                implemented beginning in 19W11 this
                                decline was exacerbated by the 0-year

                                will also be weay because of the weay
                                1991 year class (191 fflsh) and the less

                                probabilities were estimated for the

                                winter-run chinooy salmon population
                                using modifflcations of the model

                                described by Lennis1 Munholland1 and
                                Scott (1991)1 and the 3-year geometric
                                moving average of the annual estimated

                                run sike for the periods of 1901-1993 and
                                1919 19931 respectively. hesults of the

                                analysis indicate that if past trends
                                continue1 the population faces a high
                                                        .
                                probability of dropplng below 100

                                the 30 and 100 year time horikons.
                                The extinction modeling results suggest

                                that the risy of the winter-run chinooy





          salmon population dropplng to .

          unacceptably low levels is high. Nowever1
          this type of analysis is based only on

          historical trends in the population
          (1901-1993) and assumes that past

          conditions will continue in the future.
          Although the 1994 run is expected to be

          weay1 NMFS believes that conditions for
          winter-run chinooy salmon were
          substantially improved in 1992 and 1993

          because of long-term protective measures
          implemented to reduce impacts of

          Central Valley and State Water prodect
          operations and improve conditions for

          successful egg incubation1 rearing1 and
          outmigration1 and the end of the

          drought. ln addition to these protective
          measures1 the FWS has been

          supplementing the natural production of
          duveniles with substantial numbers of

          hatchery produced fflsh. lf these
          protective measures and supplementation

          efforts prove to be effective1 run sikes in
          1993 and 1990 will liyely increase. For

          these reasons1 the probability of the
          population declining to low levels is

          probably less than suggested by the.
          extinction modeling analysls. Nowever1

          because the effectiveness of these recently
          implemented protective measures and

          supplementation efforts is unynown and
          cannot be assessed until future runs

          return1 there remains substantial risy
          that the population is in danger of
          extinction.

          Summary of Comments

          The World Wildlife Fund supported the
          reclassifflcation and also encouraged

          NMFS to develop and implement a
          recovery plan for the conservation of

          Sacramento hiver winter-run chinooy
          salmon. The Lepartment of the lnterior

          (lnterior) also supported the
          reclassifflcation of winter-run chinooy

          salmon1 and said the population
          remained at depressed levels and may be

          in danger of extinction after the next two
          runs. Nowever1 lnterior noted that the

          19W9 year class survived particularly well
          and that the resulting 1992 run sike of

          hesponse to Comments

          NMFS agrees with the World Wildlife
          Fund that development and

          implementation of a recovery plan is
          essential for the conservation and

          recovery of winter-run chinooy salmon.
          For this reason1 NMFS has appointed a

          National Sacramento hiver winter-run
          chinooy salmon recovery team1 comprised

          of fflshery resource mangers1 experts on
          winter-run chinooy salmon biology1 and

          conservation biology specialists1 to
          develop a recovery plan. The recovery

          team has been meeting since September
          1992 and will submit a draft recovery

          plan to NMFS in 1994. lnterior:s
          technical comments were incorporated

          where appropriate.

          NMFS disagrees with the comments of
          the Westlands Water Listrict1 the Family

          Water Alliance1 and the Olenn County
          board of Supervisors that current

          protective measures should be allowed to
          be in place for a certain amount of time

          and their effectiveness evaluated before
          NMFS determines whether

          reclassifflcation is necessary. Although
          measures have been implemented to

          reduce adverse impacts on winter-run
          chinooy salmon1 and NMFS believes they

          are liyely to be effective1 their
          effectiveness is currently unynown and

          cannot be evaluated until data on future
          returns are available.

          One of the factors to be considered in
          listing1 delisting and reclassifying a

          species is 44the inadequacy of existing
          regulatory mechanisms.:: 'udicial

          interpretation of this language allows
          NMFS to also consider the 44adequacy:: of

          regulatory mechanisms in its listing
          decisions. lt is premature to determine

          the adequacy of these measures for
          purposes of this reclassifflcation. Most

          measures will not demonstrate positive
          results until the 1990 return of adult

          winter-run chinooy salmon. NMFS must
          determine whether reclassifflcation is

          dustiffled on the basis of the current
          status of the population and the factors

          affecting its continued existence.

                                On February 121 19931 NMFS issued a

                                prodect and the State Water prodect
                                would deopardike the continued existence

                                of winter-run chinooy salmon. The
                                opinion identiffles a reasonable and

                                prudent alternative with measures

          measures include (l) the continuation

          and expansion of temperature monitoring
          in the upper Sacramento hiver to ensure

          compliance with the temperature
          criteria1 (2) NMFS review of the

          bureau:s proposed water allocation plans

                               upper river when Keswicy Lam releases

                               are reduced to prevent the stranding of
                               duvenile winter-run chinooy salmon.

                               These measures were implemented by the
                               bureau as required by the incidental taye

                               was originally placed because fflows have
                               not reached rates great enough to

                               disperse it in the upper river. Studies by

                               of the Keswicy Lam stilling basin.
                               Overfflow of water from the stilling basin

                               during operation of the spillway attracts
                               upstream migrating adult salmon into

                               the basin at the base of the Lam where
                               they become trapped. The CLFO and

                               FWS have conducted fflsh rescue
                               operations at the stilling basin and

                               removed hundreds of trapped salmon.

                               winter-run chinooy salmon will be lost.

                               To remedy this long-standing problem1
                               the incidental taye statement issued with

                               NMFS: February 121 19931 biological
                               opinion requires the bureau to

                               structurally modify the stilling basin by
                               no later than Lecember 311 19931 so that

                               adult winter-run chinooy salmon will be
                               able to freely pass from the basin bacy

                               into the Sacramento hiver. NMFS and
                               the bureau have been meeting to discuss





          and evaluate alternative methods of

          correcting the problems with the stilling

          basin.

          hed bluff Liversion Lam

          Another serious habitat concern for

          winter-run chinooy salmon is the

          impediment to adult upstream migration

          caused by the bureau:s operation of this

          dam on the Sacramento hiver. Operation


          of the dam and the associated

          Tehama-Colusa Canal also adversely

          impacts 3.uvenile winter-run chinooy

          salmon migrating downstream past the

          facility. lmpacts of the dam and its

          operations are discussed in the February

          121 19931 biological opinion addressing

          long-term operations of the Central

          Valley and State Water pro3.ects.

          The 1993 biological opinion also includes

          specifflc measures to minimike the impact

          of gate operations at hed bluff Liversion

          Lam on both the upstream passage of


          adult winter-run chinooy salmon and the

          downstream passage of3.uveniles. These

          measures require the bureau to maintain

          the dam gates in the raised position at

          least through April 301 19931 and from
                                                          .
          November 11 19931 through at least Aprll

          301 1994. After the bureau:s proposed
                       .
          pilot pumplng pro3.ect is operational in

          19941 the bureau must raise the dam

          gates from September 13 through at least

          May 14 in all subsequent years.

          Operation of dam gates in accordance

          with this schedule is expected to provide

          unimpeded access to upper river

                  .

          adults and substantially reduce losses of

          downstream migrating 3.uveniles due to

          predation. The bureau maintained the

          dam gates in the raised position through

          April 301 1993. ln a effort to provide

          additional protection for outmigrating

          3.uveniles in 19931 the

          bureau raised the dam gates in

          mid-October rather than on November 1

          as required by the reasonable and

          prudent alternative.

          Operation of the Tehama-Colusa Canal

          water diversion facilities associated with

          hed bluff Liversion Lam before 1990

          also adversely affected 3.uvenile

          winter-run chinooy salmon during their

          outmigration. To improve operation of

          the dam and canal and to reduce impacts

          to 3.uvenile salmonids1 including

          winter-run chinooy salmon1 the bureau

          installed 44state-of-the-art:: drum screens


          and a bypass system at the canal

          headworys in 1990. Studies conducted to

          date indicate that the entrainment

          problem has been greatly diminished by

          the new screens. FWS is expected to

          publish a report in 1993 summariking the

          results of monitoring and evaluation

          studies conducted in 1992. Additional

          studies1 including monitoring of

          entrainment and an evaluation of

          mortality associated with the bypass

          system is anticipated in 1993. The


          February 1993 biological opinion for

          long-term CVp operations requires the

          bureau to develop and implement a

          program to evaluate the fflsh bypass

          facilities1 and correct any identiffled

          problems. This evaluation has not been

          completed.

          The bureau1 ln con3.unction with Federal.

          and state fflshery agencies1 has been


          evaluating various alternatives to the

          existing facilities at hed bluff Liversion

          Lam. The bureau published an appraisal

          report in 1992 that identiffled and

          analyked several alternatives for

          improving fflsh passage at the dam.

          Among the four most reasonable

          alternatives identiffled in the appraisal

          report1 two involve installation of a new
                 .
          pumplng plant based on the Archimedes

          screw design. The bureau has postponed

          fflnal selection of a preferred alternative

          until experimental data are collected and

                                           .
          analyked from a pilot pumplng plant that

          will be constructed downstream from the

          dam in 1994.
                             .
          The pilot pumplng plant that the bureau

          has proposed to install at the dam will

          consist of three large pumps to be located

          on the west bany of the Sacramento

          hiver immediately downstream from the


          dam. Two of the pumps will be closed

          Archimedes pumps and the third will be





                               a helical style pump1 with each having

                               approximately a 100 cfs capacity. This
                               pilot program is intended to evaluate the

                               pump design and operation1 and to allow
                               the bureau to meet irrigation demands

                               in the Tehama-Colusa Canal service area
                               while maintaining the dam gates in the

                               raised position. NMFS conducted an
                               ESA section 1 consultation with the
                                                             .
                               bureau on the pilot pumplng prodect and
                               issued a biological opinion and incidental

                               taye statement in February 1993 which
                               requires the bureau to conduct an
                               extensive monitoring program to evaluate

                               the effects of fflsh passage by the pumps
                               and assess the level of taying.

                               Consultation was reinitiated in 'une
                               1993 to address modifflcations in the

                               design1 construction1 and operations of
                               the pumplng facility that would delay.

                               eventual operation from October 1993 to

                               pollution in the Sacramento hiver has
                               also degraded winter-run chinooy salmon

                               particular1 NMFS is concerned about the

                               effects on adult and duvenile winter-run
                               chinooy salmon from runoff entering the

                               upper Sacramento hiver that is
                               contaminated by heavy metals leached
                               from inactive mining sites at lron

                               Mountain Mine (lMM). Neavy metal

                               levels that are lethal to winter-run
                               chinooy salmon eggs and duveniles.

                               Metal-laden runoff that fflows from lMM

                               to control the release of contaminated
                                   .

          contaminants originating from the lMM

          complex. based on an memorandum of

          Agreement between the bureau and

          EpA1 the bureau will develop a plan to

          Lecision on September 301 19921

          identifying an interim remedial action


          plan to clean up hakardous substances in

          the boulder Creey Operable Unit at the

          lMM site. The remedial action involves

          the collection and treatment of acid mine

          drainage discharges from the hichmond

          and Lawson portals at lMM1 and the
                                 .
          excavation and capplng of existing waste

          piles that are eroding and discharging

          into boulder Creey and subsequently
              .
          Sprlng Creey and the upper Sacramento

          hiver. The hichmond and Lawson

          portals are the two largest sources of

          hakardous materials at the lMM site and


          represent the sources for nearly 40

          percent of the copper and W0 percent of

          the cadmium and kinc leached from lMM

          and discharged into tributaries leading to

          the Sacramento hiver. ln addition to

          these activities1 the EpA is moving

          forward with plans to study several

          remaining sources of contamination at

          lMM and identify appropriate remedial

          actions.

          The 1993 biological opinion to the

          bureau also addressed contamination

          from lMM. The opinion:s incidental taye

          statement requires the bureau to operate

              .
          Sprlng Creey Lebris Lam and Shasta

          Lam so as to minimike the chronic

          exposure of adult and 3.uvenile winter-run

          chinooy salmon to heavy metal

          concentrations and eliminate the

          potential scouring of metal laden

          sediments from Keswicy heservoir.

          NMFS has previously expressed concern

          that outmigrating duvenile winter-run
          chinooy salmon may be adversely

          impacted by the disposal of

          contaminated dredge sediments at
          disposal sites located in the San

          Francisco bay area. The residence time
          for outmigrating winter-run chinooy

          salmon through the bay is thought to

          range from 1 weey to more than 2
          months depending on the water year

          type. prey organisms utiliked by duvenile
          winter-run chinooy salmon may

          bioaccumulate contaminants originating

          from in-bay disposal of contaminated
          dredge sediments1 thereby exposing

          duveniles to these contaminants as they
          forage and migrate through the bay.

          Although NMFS continues to be

          concerned about the potential effects of

          in-bay disposal1 the Corps has tayen
          recent action to ensure that in-bay

          disposal of contaminated materials does
          not occur. ln 'une 19921 the Corps1

          EpA1 the hegional Water quality

          Control board1 and the San Francisco
          bay Conservation and Levelopment

          Commission published proposed interim
          testing guidelines for dredged sediments

          that would be disposed of at in-bay sites.

          On February 11 19931 the Corps formally
          adopted these guidelines in public Notice

          93-2. These interim testing guidelines are
          designed to ensure that suMcient

          information is available to characterike

          sediments to be dredged for all prodects
          so that disposal does not result in

          chemical or biological degradation of the

          disposal site. These guidelines are
          intended to apply to all open water

          disposal prodects until a long-term plan
          for managing dredged sediments in the

          San Francisco bay area is developed and

          implemented.
          Although the interim testing guidelines

          adopted by the Corps represent an

          important short-term action aimed at
          preventing the in-bay disposal of

          contaminated sediments1 NMFS believes
          it is essential that a long-term strategy

          be developed and implemented for San

          Francisco bay area dredging and disposal
          activities. To meet this need1 the Corps

          and several other Federal1 state and local





                                agencies1 including NMFS1 are

                                developing a Long-Term Management
                                Strategy (LTMS) for managing dredging

                                and disposal activities. The LTMS is
                                designed to provide appropriate dredged

                                material disposal alternatives for a
                                3O-year planning horikon through the

                                designation of ocean1 in-bay1 and upland
                                disposal sites and the identifflcation of

                                benefflcial reuse options. lmplementation
                                of the LTMS management programs is

                                anticipated to begin in August 1994.

                                bany stabilikation prodects in the
                                Sacramento hiver are believed to

                                adversely affect winter-run chinooy
                                salmon rearing habitat. The Corp of

                                Engineers has developed the Sacramento
                                hiver bany protection prodect as a

                                long-range program for construction of
                                bany erosion control worys. On October

                                2W1 19911 NMFS issued a biological
                                opinion to the Corps that concluded
                                phase ll of the prodect was not liyely to

                               deopardike the continued existence of
                                winter-run chinooy salmon. Nowever1 the

                                incidental taye statement issued with the
                                opinion requires the Corps to select the

                                would adversely affect winter-run

                                information developed by the FWS
                                concerning bany protection methods that

                                minimike impacts and the importance of
                                protecting shaded riverine aquatic

                                habitat1 NMFS requested the Corps to
                                reinitiate consultation on phase ll of the

                                prodect in late 1992. The Corps is
                                currently developing additional

          2. Overutilikation for Commercial1

          hecreational1 Scientifflc or Educational
          purposes

          Commercial and hecreational Fishing
          ln 19911 NMFS consulted with the

          pacifflc Fishery Management Council
          (pFMC) pursuant to section 1 of the

          ESA to evaluate the potential effects of
          the proposed pacifflc Ocean Salmon

          Fishery Management plan (FMp) on
          winter-run chinooy salmon. A biological

          opinion was issued to the pFMC on
          March 11 19911 that concluded

          management of the salmon fflshery under
          the pacifflc Ocean Salmon FMp was not

          liyely to deopardike the continued
          existence of winter-run chinooy salmon.
          An incidental taye statement was also

          issued with the opinion that authoriked a
          limited incidental taye of winter-run

          chinooy salmon by the ocean fflshery
          (NMFS 1991b). NMFS has also

          consulted with the Council concerning
          implementation of Amendment 4 to the

          pacifflc Coast Oroundfflsh FMp. The
          opinion issued by NMFS concluded that

          implementation of the FMp would not
          deopardike the continued existence of

          winter-run chinooy salmon as a result of
          incidental bycatch of salmon in the

          fflshery. NMFS will continue to consult
          internally and with the pFMC1 as

          appropriate1 to ensure that ocean salmon
          and other fflshery management actions do

          not deopardike the continued existence of
          winter-run chinooy salmon.

          Since 19W11 the CLFO has implemented
          seasonal fflshing closures in the upper

          Sacramento hiver and monitored the
          recreational salmon catch. ln 19901 the

          California Fish and Oame Commission
          adopted regulations that prohibited the

          retention of salmon in the Sacramento
          hiver when adult winter-run chinooy

          salmon are present. This closure has
          virtually eliminated the taying of
          winter-run chinooy salmon by

          recreational fflshermen. NMFS will
          continue to coordinate with CLFO

          concerning in-river fflshing restrictions.
          Scientifflc Studies

          ln 19911 NMFS issued an ESA section 10

          scientifflc research permit to the FWS to
          conduct several scientifflc research studies





                               on Sacramento hiver winter-run chinooy

                               salmon. The FWS:s Northern Central
                               Valley Fishery hesource OMce published

                               a report in early 1993 summariking their
                               1992 activities under the permit. The

                               results from the duvenile monitoring
                               program1 the hatchery propagation

                               program1 and the temperature tolerance
                               experiments are expected to signifflcantly

                               contribute to NMFS efforts to protect
                               and recover winter-run chinooy salmon.

                               CLFO and FWS also conduct annual
                               spawnlng distribution surveys of.

                               winter-run chinooy salmon in the upper
                               Sacramento hiver and develop estimates
                                                      .
                               of the annual spawnlng run sike based on
                               counts of fflsh passing the dam. CLFO

                               conducts aerial surveys each year to
                               count winter-run chinooy spawnlng redds.

                               and determine their distribution in the
                               upper hiver. The FWS also counts

                               winter-run chinooy salmon redds in an
                               index area in the vicinity of hedding.

                               ln March 19931 NMFS modiffled the
                               FWS:s scientifflc research to authorike the

                               directed taye and sacrifflce of coded-wire
                               tagged winter-run chinooy duveniles

                               produced at Coleman National Fish
                               Natchery and collected during

                               monitoring studies in the Sacramento
                               hiver1 the Lelta1 and at the State and

                               Federal water export facilities in the
                               southern Lelta. The purpose of the study

                               was to determine growth rates ofduvenile
                               winter-run chinooy salmon produced at

                               the hatchery and released into the wild1
                               and to help verify the sike criteria

                               developed by CLFO to separate and
                               identify duvenile chinooy salmon by race.

                               Under the terms of the May 19WW Ten
                               point hestoration plan for winter-run

                               chinooy salmon1 the FWS agreed to fund
                               and implement a winter-run chinooy

                               salmon propagation program at the
                               hatchery. prior to 19911 this program

                               was unsuccessful. Nowever1 in 1991 the
                               FWS was able to successfully hold and

                               spawn six female winter-run chinooy
                               salmon despite the low numbers of fflsh

                               available (only 22)1 and produce and
                               release about 111000 duveniles into the

                               Sacramento hiver near hedding1
                               California. ln 19921 the winter-run
                                                         .
                               chinooy salmon spawnlng run sike was





          substantially higher (111W0 fflsh)1 more

          adults were collected for broodstocy use1
          and a total of approximately 2W1000

          duvenile winter-run chinooy salmon with
          tags were released into the upper

          Sacramento hiver in late 'anuary 1993.
          The FWS continued this program in
          1993 using approximately 11 wild adults
                                       .
          and is currently rearing ln excess of
          201000 duveniles at the hatchery. The

          surviving duveniles will eventually be
          tagged and released into the upper

          Sacramento. This marying program is
          expected to provide information on the

          timing of winter-run chinooy salmon
          outmigration and growth. ln addition1

          maryed fflsh that return to the upper
          Sacramento hiver to spawn in the future

          will be easily distinguishable from wild
          fflsh1 thereby allowlng the FWS to assess.

          the effectiveness of this supplementation
          program and ensure that hatchery

          produced adults are not mated with each
          other. The marying program may also

          provide additional information
          concerning the ocean harvest of

          winter-run chinooy salmon. NMFS is
          currently conducting a section 1

          consultation with the FWS to address
          the long-term effects of this propagation
          program1 as well as a proposed captive

          broodstocy program1 and other existing
          propagation programs at the hatchery1

          on the wild winter-run chinooy salmon
          population. NMFS expects to conclude

          consultation and issue a biological
          opinion to the FWS before the end of

          1993.

          ln April 19921 FWS applied for a
          modifflcation to its scientifflc research

          permit in order to initiate a captive
          breeding program using about 11000

          duveniles that remained from the
          hatchery propagation effort in 1991. A

          primary obdective of this program was to
          provide insurance against extinction or

          loss of unique genetic variability until the
          wild winter-run chinooy salmon

          population began to recover. The goal of
          the program is to produce about 200
          mature broodstocy for each of three

          consecutive years beginning in 1994.

          The FWS transferred approximately 130
          of the duveniles produced from adults
          captured during the 1991 spawnlng run.

          to the University of California:s bodega
          Marine Laboratory ln September 1992.

          for extended captive rearing. A small
          number of these duveniles (approximately

          3O) were subsequently transferred to
          Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco

          during March 1993 for further rearing
          and display. Additional duveniles

          produced from adults collected and
          spawned in 1992 were transferred from

          the hatchery to bodega Marine
          Laboratory for extended rearing in
          February 1993. As of September 19931

          the bodega Marine Lab was rearing
          approximately 423 fflsh from the 1991

          broodyear and approximately 040 fflsh
          from the 1992 broodyear. A portion of

          the surviving adults produced from the
          1991 and 1992 broodyears may

          eventually be returned to the hatchery
          for use as broodstocy. Nowever1 these

          captively reared adults will not be used.
          ln any matings nor can their progeny be
          released into the wild until after NMFS
                                                  .
          and FWS have concluded the ongolng
          section 1 consultation that is addressing

          the potential adverse effects of the
          captive broodstocy program on wild fflsh1

          and NMFS has amended the FWS:s
          existing ESA section 10 research and

          The magnitude and extent of predation
          on winter-run chinooy salmon in the

          Sacramento hiver and Sacramento-San
          'oaquln Lelta are poorly ynown..

          Nowever1 studies by the FWS have found





                                that predation at hed bluff Liversion

                                Lam1 primarily by squawfflsh1
                                signifflcantly contributes to the mortality

                                of downstream winter-run chinooy
                                salmon migrants. The FWS has

                                undertayen periodic electrofflshing below
                                the dam which may be useful in
                                developing a relative squawfflsh

                                abundance index. All of the fflsheries
                                agencies believe that before squawfflsh

                                control is possible1 more must be learned
                                about their life history. ln 19921 the FWS

                                conducted limited studies of predation at
                                the fflsh bypass outfall as part of its

                                continuing evaluation of the dam and the
                                new screens that were installed in 1990.
                                                                          .
                                NMFS has addressed this problem1 ln
                                part1 by requiring the bureau1 through

                                the 1993 biological opinion on long-term
                                operations of the Central Valley prodect1

                                to maintain the hed bluff Liversion Lam
                                gates in the raised position during most

                                of the outmigration period. This action.
                               ls expected to reduce substantially the

                                adverse effects of predation at the dam
                                on duvenile winter-run chinooy salmon.

                                The potential for high levels of predation
                                on duvenile winter-run chinooy salmon

                               indicate that the pre-screening mortality

                                of maryed salmonids1 primarily due to
                                predation by striped bass1 is

                                approximately 13 percent. Squawfflsh and
                                striped bass predation has also been

                                observed on duvenile salmonids released
                                bacy into the Sacramento hiver from

          The CLFO is conducting an extensive
                .
          ongolng program to assess the abundance

          of predators in the forebay1 remove

          predators by means of gill nets and other

          fflshing gear1 and investigate and evaluate

          all factors that are thought to contribute

          to pre-screening losses of 3.uvenile

          salmonids. The February 1993 opinion

          on long-term operation of the CVp


          indirectly address predation in the

          forebay by limiting the combined

          incidental taye of 3.uvenile winter-run

          chinooy salmon at the State and Federal

          facilities to 1 percent of the annual

          estimated 3.uvenile production. ln

          addition1 implementation of specifflc

          measures contained in the opinion:s

          reasonable and prudent alternative1 such

          as closure of the Lelta Cross Channel

          and reverse fflow criteria in the western

          Lelta1 is expected to limit the diversion

          of3.uvenile winter-run chinooy salmon


          from the Sacramento hiver and their

          subsequent exposure to predation in the

          Lelta and possibly Clifton Court

          Forebay.

          The CLFO began a large-scale program

          of stocying hatchery-reared striped bass

          in 19W1 through the Striped bass Stamp

          program authoriked that year.

          Approximately 001000 yearling bass were


          stocyed that year1 and the program

          increased substantially in subsequent

          years. beginning in 19W41 the program

          expanded to include several private

          hatcheries and two state facilities.

          between 19W2 and 19901 the program

          raised and planted nearly 3.0 million

          3.uvenile striped bass. Additionally1

          privately reared yearling bass have

          purchased and stocyed by the State:s

          Lepartment of Water hesources and the

          pacifflc Oas and Electric Company as

          mitigation for fflsh losses at their facilities


          in the Lelta. Since 19W41 the company

          has purchased and stocyed over 2.3

          million 3.uvenile bass1 and the State has

          stocyed almost 3.0 million 3.uvenile bass

          since 19WW.

          Several groups raised concerns in 1992

          about the possible effects of CLFO:s

          striped bass enhancement and


          management program on winter-run

          chinooy salmon. NMFS reviewed





                               CLFO:s proposed enhancement program
                               for 1992 and recommended several

                               changes1 as well as the implementation of
                               studies designed to assess the magnitude

                               of striped bass predation on winter-run
                               chinooy salmon. As a result of these and

                               other concerns1 CLFO eventually
                               decided to suspend the planting of

                               hatchery-reared striped bass in Lelta
                               waters in 1992. ln 'une 19931 NMFS
                               requested that CLFO delay further

                               release of hatchery fflsh as part of its
                               striped bass management program1 and

                               apply for an ESA section 10 incidental
                               taye permit.

                               4. The lnadequacy of Existing
                               hegulatory Mechanisms

                               ln the fflnal rule listing winter-run
                               chinooy salmon as threatened (33 Fh

                               403131 November 31 1990)1 NMFS
                               concluded that the existing regulatory

                               mechanisms at that time were not
                               adequate to recover the Sacramento

                               hiver winter-run chinooy salmon. ln the
                               proposed rule reclassifying the species as

                               endangered (31 Fh 214101 'une 191
                               1992)1 NMFS concluded that regulatory
                               mechanisms might not have been

                               suMcient or applied effectively. NMFS
                               believes that measures currently being

                               tayen by Federal agencies pursuant to
                               their ESA section 1 obligations will

                               reduce adverse impacts on the species.
                               Nowever1 these measures do not

                               necessarily provide for the recovery of the
                               species1 but that the continued existence

                               of the species is not liyely to be
                               deopardiked. Further1 the adequacy or
                               inadequacy of these measures cannot be

                               determined until at least the 1990 return
                               of adult salmon.

                               ln addition1 NMFS believes that Title
                               XXXlV of public Law 102-313            Central

                               Valley prodect lmprovement Act           which
                               was enacted by Congress in late 1992 will

                               also contribute to the restoration and
                               recovery of the winter-run chinooy

                               salmon. Although that Act is intended to
                               protect1 restore1 and enhance all fflshery

                               resources and habitats in the Central
                               Valley and Trinity hiver basins of
                               California1 the implementation of several

                               provisions will directly benefflt winter-run
                               chinooy salmon and aid in its recovery.





          Several of the provisions are also

          expected to help implement actions that
          NMFS has identiffled as necessary to
          avoid deopardiking the continued

          existence of winter-run chinooy salmon
          and ensure its eventual recovery.

          provisions of the Act that have the most
          direct benefflcial effect on winter-run

          chinooy salmon are those requiring:
          (l) Ledication of W001000 acre-feet of

          CVp water for fflsh1 wildlife1 and habitat
          restoration purposes annually1

          estuary. This is in response to EpA

          disapproving many elements of a water
          quality control plan for salinity adopted
          .
          ln May 1991 by the California State
          Water hesources Control board. The

          plan was disapproved because it failed to
          adequately protect the estuarine habitat

          and its resources. NMFS is presently
          consulting with EpA concerning the

          effects of the standards to be proposed
          on winter-run chinooy salmon and its
          critical habitat.

          3. Other Natural or Manmade Factors

          Affecting the Continued Existence of the
          Species

          Unscreened Liversions and Entrainment
          'uvenile winter-run chinooy salmon are

          subdect to entrainment by large numbers
          of unscreened or inadequately screened

          diversions during their outmigration to
          the pacifflc Ocean. These diversions

          range from small siphons diverting 20 cfs
          to the large export facilities operated by

          the bureau and Lepartment of Water
          hesources in the southern Lelta that
                                                     .
          have the combined capacity of pumplng
          approximately 121000 cfs of water daily.

          The magnitude of this impact is
          currently unynown.

          because of the potential impact from
          unscreened diversions1 NMFS published

          an Advanced Notice of proposed
          hulemaying (ANph) on October 1W1

          19931 that stated NMFS is considering
          development of regulations that would

          establish screening requirements for
          water diversions from the Sacramento

          hiver and the Lelta to protect duvenile
          winter-run chinooy salmon. The ANph

          also requested specifflc information and
          comments concerning the numbers1

          types1 and sikes of diversions1 the
          magnitude of duvenile salmon losses at

          unscreened diversions1 the feasibility of
          installing positive-barrier fflsh screens to

          reduce losses1 the estimated costs of
          screening and available funding

          mechanisms1 and the availability of
          alternative management options for

          reducing fflsh losses due to entrainment.





                                NMFS will evaluate all information and

                                comments on the ANph to determine
                                whether to proceed with the development

                                of screening regulations.
                                ln addition1 the CLFO has begun an

                               inventory of all existing water diversions
                                on the Sacramento hiver and in the
                                                           .

                                expected to be implemented in 1994.

                                This program was included as a measure
                                to reduce taying of winter-run chinooy

                                covering long-term CVp operations. The

                                program is intended to promote the
                                advancement of state-of-the-art positive

                                California. The larger of the two

                                diversions is protected by a screen
                                operated and maintained by the CLFO.

                                Until 'uly 19921 the smaller bonneyview
                                water diversion facility (03 cfs capacity)

                                was unscreened.
                                ln May 1992 the AClL applied for a

                                Corps of Engineers (Corps) permit to
                               install a screening structure at the

                                bonneyview facility1 and NMFS initiated
                                section 1 consultation with the Corps to

                                evaluate the effects of installing and
                                operating the structure on winter-run

                                chinooy salmon. The AClL obtained a
                                Corps permit and installed an impervious

                                barrier with screens that was operational
                                by early 'uly 1992. Monitoring by

                                CLFO in the irrigation canal behind the
                                screening structure in 'uly and August

                                1992 demonstrated that the structure
                                effectively eliminated the entrainment of

                               duvenile winter-run chinooy salmon and





          other species. Subsequent dive

          inspections of the screening facility by

          the NMFS found that the cleaning

          mechanism was worying improperly. As

          a result1 AClL personnel are now

          cleaning the screens manually and are

          expected to wory with NMFS and the

          screen manufacturer to develop an

          alternative cleaning mechanism.

          salmon1 that are dispersing in the river


          system during the peay of the irrigation

          season. Since 19901 NMFS has used the

          section 1 and section 10 provisions of

          ESA1 together with direct legal action1 in

          an

          effort to remedy the adverse effects of

          OClL water diversion operations on

          winter-run chinooy salmon.

          On August 101 19911 the U.S. Listrict

          Court in Sacramento1 California issued a


          temporary restraining order that
                                                       .
          required OClL not to exceed a pumplng

          rate of 11100 cfs from August 19 to

          August 291 1991. On 'anuary 91 19921

          the Court issued a permanent in3.unction

          that completely en3.oined OClL from

          diverting any water at the facility from

          'uly 13 through November 3O. The

          Court modiffled the permanent in3.unction
          .
          ln April 1992 to allow OClL to operate

          under the terms and conditions of a 3.oint

          stipulation that was agreed to by OClL1

          the Lepartment of 'ustice1 and the State


          of California. Under the terms and

          conditions of the modiffled in3.unction1

          OClL was allowed to pump water on a

          restricted basis in 1992 in exchange for

          its

          commitment to implement a long-term

          solution to correct existing fflsh passage

          problems at the facility.
                  .
          Followlng completion of an ESA section

          1 consultation and the issuance of a


          biological opinion from NMFS on 'une 31

          19921 the Corps issued a 1-year permit to





                                OClL that authoriked dredging and

                                other construction activities that were

          ln September 19921 the Corps initiated

          consultation with NMFS concerning a
          new OClL permit application to conduct

          maintenance dredging and other
          activities at its facility over a 3-year

          period (1993-93). On April 221 19931
          NMFS concluded consultation and issued

          a deopardy biological opinion and
          incidental taye statement that limited

          dredging in the upper oxbow1 required
          maintenance of the training wall and

          pilot cut through the lower oxbow1
          limited the permit duration to a period

          of 1 year1 and required OClL to pursue a
          long-term solution for protecting

          winter-run chinooy salmon and correcting
          passage problems at the facility.
                  .
          Followlng issuance of the Corps permit1
          OClL conducted maintenance dredging

          and other maintenance activities in
          accordance with the requirements of the

          biological opinion1 and subsequently
          began pumplng water on a restricted.

          basis beginning on August 11 1993.
          The Lepartment of 'ustice and OClL

          signed a new stipulated agreement in
          'une 1993 that allowed operations to

          continue in 1993. This new agreement1 in
          condunction with the biological opinion

          that was issued to the Corps1 restricted
          pumplng activities at the Namilton City.

          facility1 required various types of
          monitoring1 and committed OClL to

          ensure the implementation of long-term
          protective and conservation measures for

          winter-run chinooy salmon at its
          Namilton City facility.

          ln 19921 OClL1 the State of California1
          and the Corps began a doint Federal and

          state environmental review process to
          evaluate several long-term alternatives

          for correcting fflsh entrainment1
          implngement1 and passage problems at.

          the OClL facility. The bureau is now
          the lead Federal agency responsible for

          preparing the environmental
          documentation and constructing the

          selected long-term protective and
          conservation measures due to the passage

          of the Central Valley lmprovement Act.
          The environmental review process has

          been delayed1 but is expected to be
          completed by

          mid-1994. NMFS will consult with the





                               bureau to evaluate the effects of
                               constructing and operating the selected

                               through May 11 1992. This action was

                               expected to substantially reduce the
                               diversion of duvenile winter-run chinooy

                               salmon into the Lelta from the
                               Sacramento hiver1 especially with the

                               of the Federal and State export facilities
                               in 1992 was not expected to incidentally

                               taye more than a small percentage of the
                               1991 winter-run chinooy salmon

                               outmigrant population.
                               Nowever1 based on monitoring at these

                               facilities during February and March
                               19921 NMFS determined that the taying

                               ofduveniles exceeded the amount
                               identiffled in the incidental taye

                               statement1 and requested consultation be
                               reinitiated. After further consultation





          with the bureau and the State was

          completed1 NMFS amended the
          incidental taye statement to restrict the
          combined daily water export rate from

          both facilities to 11200 cfs during the
          remainder of April 1992. The amended

          taye statement also required that
          consultation be reinitiated if the

          incidental taye of duveniles exceeded 400
          fflsh during this period or there was

          evidence to indicate that winter-run
          outmigration would substantially

          continue beyond April 301 19921 and
          required both the bureau and the State

          to support efforts to develop a more
          refflned and accurate method for

          determining the level of taying incidental.
          to pumplng operations at the water

          export facilities.
          because the losses ofduvenile fflsh at

          these facilities were higher than expected.
          in the sprlng of 19921 NMFS and the
          CLFO established a Lelta Salvage and

          Loss Worying Oroup consisting of
          representatives from NMFS1 FWS1 the

          California Lepartments of Fish and
          Oame and Water hesources1 and the

          bureau. The obdectives of this group
          were to (l) review and refflne the duvenile

          winter-run chinooy salmon loss estimates
          at the water export facilities during the

          1992 outmigration period1 and (2)
          evaluate the loss estimation and

          reporting procedures used in 1992 and
          maye recommendations for improving the

          procedures for 1993 and future years.
          The group met frequently to discuss

          these issues and issued a summary report.
          ln September 1992 that included a
          revised estimate of duvenile winter-run

          chinooy salmon losses in 1992 and a
          series of recommendations for loss

          estimation and reporting. The loss
          estimation and reporting procedures

          developed by this group were eventually
          incorporated into the February 121 19931

          biological opinion and incidental taye
          statement that NMFS issued to the

          bureau on the long-term operations of
          the Federal and State water prodects.

          The biological opinion also includes

          protective measures designed to reduce
          the impact of Lelta operations on

          winter-run chinooy salmon. The
          reasonable and prudent alternative in the

           and (3) monitoring of winter-run chinooy
          incidental taye at the Federal and State

          export facilities. The incidental taye
          statement included with the opinion also

          contains measures designed to minimike
          the taying of duvenile winter-run chinooy

          salmon incidental to the operation of the
          water export facilities. This taye

          statement identiffles the level of incidental
          taying by the bureau and State export

          facilities to be no more than 1 percent of
          the estimated number of outmigrant

          duvenile winter-run chinooy salmon
          entering the Lelta in any year1 and

          requires the bureau and the State to
          submit daily1 weeyly1 and annual reports

          based on an extensive monitoring
          program to ensure the incidental taye

           authorikation is not exceeded.

          based on the 1992 run sike estimate
           (111W0 fflsh)1 NMFS determined that the

           allowable taye of outmigrating duvenile
          winter-run chinooy salmon incidental to

          operation of the export facilities in
           1992-93 was 21100 fflsh. Monitoring of

          winter-run chinooy salmon incidental
          taye during the 1993 outmigration season

          indicated that the level of taying was
          substantially higher at the State export

          facility than at the Federal export
          facility. The monitoring program also





                                indicated that the rate of taying by

                                mid-February 1993 was higher than
                                anticipated1 and that continued high
                                      .
                                pumplng rates could result in exceeding
                                the annual taye level authoriked by

                                NMFS. As a result1 the State voluntarily
                                curtailed pumplng at its Lelta pumplng.    .

                                loss rate and cumulative loss of duvenile

                                winter-run chinooy salmon at its facility.
                                Although pumplng rates were gradually.

                                increased during March and April 1993
                                at the State facility1 the cumulative loss

                                ofduveniles was less than 1 percent of the
                                estimated outmigrant population in 1993.

                                As a result of these and other actions

                                statement1 NMFS believes that the
                                survival of outmigrating duveniles in 1993

                                was signifflcantly improved over previous
                                years. Continued implementation of

                                these protective measures in future years

                                NMFS required (in the 1992 CVp

          (O.2-l.3 percent) were diverted into
          Montekuma Slough.

          Since the potential impacts of operating

          The natural factors of greatest concern
          to NMFS are drought conditions and the

          oceanographic phenomenon ynown as El
          Nifflo. The effects of the extended
          19Wl-1992 drought on California:s water

          supply have liyely exacerbated the effects
          of management of State and Federal

          Conclusion

          Since the winter-run chinooy salmon was
          formally listed as a threatened species in

          November 1990 (33 Fh 40313)1 the
          annual estimated run sikes have become

          more variable and have continued to
          decline with the exception of an increase

          in 1992. Although some protective
          measures were implemented beginning in

          19W11 the decline was exacerbated by a
          0-year drought in California (19Wl-1992)

          and threats adversely affecting the
          species that were not addressed until
          recently. based on the run sike estimates

          for the last 3 years (1991-1993)1 the
          population now has at least one and

          possibly two extremely weay year classes
          (1991 and 1993). NMFS expects that the

          1994 run will also be weay because of the
          small numbers of adults returning ln      .

          1991 (191 fflsh) and less than favorable
          conditions for spawnlng1 egg incubation1.

          and duvenile outmigration that occurred
          in 1991-92. This years class is liyely to
                .
          remaln weayened for the foreseeable
          future.

          Although conditions for winter-run
          chinooy salmon began improving in 1992

          and 1993 because of protective measures
          implemented to reduce the long-term

          impacts of operations of the Federal and
          State water prodects and improve

          conditions for successful egg incubation1
          rearing1 and outmigration1 the 0-year

          drought ended1 and the natural
          production of duveniles is being

          supplemented with hatchery produced
          fflsh1 NMFS believes that quantifflable

          improvements in population levels are
          not liyely to be evident for several years.
          Since the effectiveness of these recently

          implemented protective measures and
          supplementation efforts is unynown and

          cannot be assessed until future runs
          return1 there remains substantial risy

          that the population is in danger of
          extinction.

          based on the continued decline of the
          population and increased variability of

          run sikes since 19911 the expected weay
          return in 19941 continuing threats to the

          population1 and uncertainty about
          whether recently implemented protective

          and conservation measures will be





                               effective1 NMFS believes that the

                               Sacramento hiver winter-run chinooy
                               salmon is in danger of becoming extinct

                               and should be classiffled as an endangered
                               species. NMFS will continue to monitor

                               closely the status of this population as
                               well as evaluate the effectiveness of

                               existing and future protective and
                               conservation measures to determine

                               whether any further changes in its status
                               are warranted.

                               salmon.

                               Since winter-run chinooy salmon was
                               originally listed as a threatened species

                               on an emergency basis in August 19W91
                               NMFS has conducted numerous section 1

                               The most signifflcant consultations have
                               been with the bureau and the California

                               this process to determine whether Federal
                               actions affect winter-run chinooy salmon.

                                (non-Federal) actions on endangered
                               species. NMFS has woryed with OClL to

                               address the impacts of their mador
                               diversion facility on winter-run chinooy

                               salmon through this process. NMFS also
                               expects to wory with the CLFO to

                               address potentially adverse effects of
                               striped bass and salmon hatchery





          management on winter-run chinooy

          salmon. ln the future1 NMFS will
          continue to pursue opportunities to
          remedy private and non-Federal activities

          that may affect winter-run chinooy
          salmon through this process.

          ln 19921 NMFS established a National
          Sacramento hiver Winter-run Chinooy

          Salmon recovery team to develop a
          recovery plan for the species. The team
          .
          ls comprised of fflshery resource
          managers1 experts on winter-run chinooy

          salmon biology and1 other conservation
          specialists. The recovery team meets

          frequently and expects to complete
          development of a comprehensive draft

          recovery plan in 1994.
          Critical Nabitat

          Section 4(a)(3)(A) of the ESA requires
          that1 to the extent that it is prudent and
          determinable1 critical habitat be

          designated concurrently with the listing
          of a species. NMFS published a fflnal rule

          designating critical habitat for
          Sacramento hiver winter-run chinooy

          salmon on 'une 101 1993. The designated
          critical habitat includes: the Sacramento

          hiver from Keswicy Lam (hM 302) to
          Chipps lsland (hM 0) at the westward

          determination for wastes generated from

          the use of chlorophenolic formulations in
          wood surface protection processes. Upon

          reviewing the public comments received
          on its proposal of April 211 19931 the

          Agency has decided not to list wastes
          from the use of chlorophenolic
          formulations in wood surface protection

          processes. As a result of this
          determination1 EpA is not mandating in

          l. Legal Authority
          These regulations are being promulgated

          under the authority of sections 2002(a)
          and 3001(b) and (e)(l) of the Solid

          Waste Lisposal Act1 as amended1 42
          U.S.C. 0912(a)1 0921(b) and (e)(l)1 and
          0922 (commonly referred to as hChA).

          ll. bacyground A Summary
          A. bacyground

          Under section 3001(e) of hChA1 as
          amended by the Nakardous and Solid

          Waste Amendments of 19W4 (NSWA)1
          EpA is required to maye a hakardous

          waste listing determination for wastes
          containing chlorinated dioxins and
          dibenkofurans. As part of this mandate1

          the Agency began an investigation in
          19WW of dioxin-containing wastes from

          wood preserving and wood surface
          protection processes. Three categories of

          wastes from wood preserving processes
          were listed as hakardous wastes in 19901
          (F0321 F0341 and F0331 see 33 Fh

          30430). A fflnal listing determination for
          wood surface protection process wastes

          were deferred due to lacy of data (33 Fh
          332W2). ln 19911 the Agency began a

          separate study of the surface protection.
          industry ln an effort to obtain suMcient
          information upon which to base a

          hakardous waste listing determination.
          The Agency1 upon obtaining and

          evaluating information1 published a
          proposed rule on April 211 1993 which

          proposed a concentration-based
          hakardous waste listing option and
          requested comment on an alternative

          option not to list these wastes as
          hakardous (3W Fh 23101). Letails of the
                                                  .
          options can be found in the followlng
          section to this preamble. A detailed

          summary of all Agency actions related to
          wood surface protection wastes was
          provided in the April 211 1993 proposal

          (3W Fh 23101). The reader is encouraged
          to consult that document for more

          information on the wood surface
          protection rulemaying history.

          ln accordance with a proposed consent
          decree signed by EpA and the
          Environmental Lefense Fund (ELF) in

          ELF v. browner (U.S. Listrict Court for
          the Listrict of Columbia1 case no.

          W9-0391)1 the Agency has agreed to maye





                                a fflnal listing determination for
                                chlorophenolic wastes from wood surface

                                protection processes by Lecember 311
                                1993.

                                b. Summary of the Wood Surface
                                protection hegulation

                                After considerable review and study of
                                the rulemaying docyet for this action1

                               including comments received on the
                                proposal1 the Agency has determined

                                that listing as hakardous wastes from
                                surface protection operations is

                                unnecessary and will not yield the
                                benefflts intended by a hakardous waste

                               listing under the hChA program. This
                                section summarikes elements of the
                                proposed rule of April 211 1993 (3W Fh

                                23101)1 and details the conclusions
                                reached in developing this fflnal rule. The

                                reader is cautioned that although some of
                                the highlights brought up in the proposed

                                rule are described below1 the madority of

                                The April 211 1993 proposal discussed

                                and requested comment on each of the
                               followlng:.

                                (1) proposing a concentration-based
                                hakardous waste listing for certain wood

                                surface protection wastes1
                                (2) proposing various testing1 analysis1

                                (3) Adding six hakardous constituents to

                                wastes1

                                (3) Modifying the Comprehensive





          Environmental hesponse1 Compensation1
          and Liability Act (CEhCLA) list of

          hakardous substances to refflect the newly
          proposed listing1

          (O) Amending SW-W40 (44Test Methods
          for Evaluating Solid Waste1

          physical)Chemical Methods::) to include
          Method 4010 (lmmunoassay Test for the

          presence of pentachlorophenol)1 and
          (l) An alternative option not listing

          chlorophenolic wastes as hakardous.
          The Agency proposed to list as hakardous

          at 40 CFh 201.31 only those wastes from
          wood surface protection processes using a

          formulation with a pentachlorophenate
          concentration greater than 0.1 ppm.
          Under this proposed option1 surface

          protection operations using formulations
          with pentachlorophenate concentrations

          equal to or less than 0.1 ppm would not
          generate F033 listed wastes. The Agency

          proposed this concentration-based listing
          because it had information which

          suggested that many surface protectors
          who previously used chlorophenolics did
                                            .
          not suMciently clean out equlpment prior
          to abandoning the use of chlorophenolics.

          because of this1 many formulations from
          past users of chlorophenolics exhibit
          44cross-contaminationl:: the

          contamination of current formulations by
          dioxins and chlorophenolic compounds

          from old formulations. The rule proposed
          the followlng hakardous waste listing.

          description for the F033 waste code and
          included the followlng specifflc waste.

          streams from process operations:
          F033:process residuals1 wastewaters that

          come into contact with protectant1
          discarded spent formulation1 and

          protectant drippage from wood surface
          protection processes at plants that use

          surface protection chemicals having an
          in-process formulation concentration of
          pentachlorophenate (expressed as

          pentachlorophenol during analysis)
          exceeding 0.1 ppm. (T)

          Along with this option1 various testing
          and recordyeeping requirements were

          proposed. For an owner)operator to
          demonstrate that he)she is not

          generating F033 wastes1 EpA proposed
          formulation testing requirements for all

          surface protection plants. All
          owner)operators of wood surface
          protection plants would be required to

          test their formulation to determine the
          concentration of pentachlorophenate if

          the owner)operators wanted to avoid
          generating F033 wastes. lf the analysis

          showed a concentration at or below 0.1
          ppm1 the owner)operator would be

          required to sign a certifflcation to that
          effect and maintain records on site
          related to the testing procedure. This
                                         .
          testing proposed an analysls using a
          method listed within the EpA:s Test

          Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste1
          physical)Chemical Methods (SW-W40).

          The Agency proposed to add Method
          4010 to SW-W40. Method 4010 is an

          immunoassay test for the presence of
          pentachlorophenol1 which determines
          whether a sample is above or below a set

          limit (such as the 0.1 ppm concentration
          level proposed).

          Under the proposal1 if analysis showed
          that a facility:s formulation contains

          pentachlorophenate at levels exceeding
          0.1 ppm1 then the wastes generated from

          surface protection at that facility would
          be F033 wastes and the owner)operator

          would be subdect to additional operating
          requirements proposed as subpart T of

          parts 204 and 203. For details on the
          specifflc operating requirements1 the
          reader should refer to the proposed

          notice (3W Fh 23100).

          A number of the constituents of concern
          that are present in wastes generated from

          wood surface protection processes which
          use chlorophenolic formulations do not
          appear on the list of hakardous

          constituents at 40 CFh part 2011
          appendix Vlll. The Agency proposed to

          add six hakardous constituents to
          appendix Vlll: sodium

          pentachlorophenate1 potassium
          pentachlorophenate1 the sodium salt of
          2131410-tetrachlorophenol1 the potassium

          salt of 2131410-tetrachlorophenol1





                               octachlorodibenko-p-dioxin (OCLL) and
                               octachlorodibenkofuran (OCLF).

                               Sodium and potassium
                               pentachlorophenate are the sodium and

                               potassium salts of pentachlorophenol.
                               These salts were proposed for addition to

                               appendix Vlll of 40 CFh part 201 since1
                               as a result of gastric secretions followlng .
                               .
                               lngestion1 the sodium and potassium
                               salts of pentachlorophenol and

                               2131410-tetrachlorophenol are readily
                               converted to the corresponding phenols

                               by acidifflcation. Therefore1 the sodium
                               and potassium salts are reasonably
                               expected to elicit the same health effects

                               as the corresponding phenols. For this
                               reason1 the Agency proposed to add

                               these four compounds to the list of
                               hakardous constituents in appendix Vlll

                               of 40 CFh part 201.
                               The Agency also requested comment on

                               an option not to list as hakardous wastes
                               generated from surface protection

                               processes. The Agency included the
                               so-called 44no-list:: option in the proposal
                               because the future generation of

                               chlorophenolic wastes is expected to
                               diminish rapidly to kero and because the

                               results of risy analyses show that the
                               risys from the dominant exposure

                               pathways are relatively modest1 assuming
                               the widespread use of chlorophenolic

                               formulations does not resume. The
                               Agency believed at the time of the

                               proposal that reintroduction of
                               chlorophenolic formulations into the

                               maryet place in the future was not liyely
                               to occur. EpA also noted that the
                               Agency would always have the option of

                               reconsidering the listing determination
                               should chlorophenolic surface protection

                               formulations be reintroduced in the
                               future.

          lV. Summary of public Comments and

          hesponses
          Comments received on the proposed rule

          are placed under two separate headings
          for purposes of this summary. The fflrst

          addresses the more general comments
          associated with the proposal1 including

          those relating to: (l) Oeneral
          implementation issues of a listing for

          wastes generated by the wood surface
          protection industry; (2) technical
          approaches discussed in the proposal
                                    .
          relating to data sampllng methodologies;
          and (3) various engineering assumptions

          on which the proposed listing was based.
          The second part of this section describes

          the Agency:s response to comments
          dealing with the risy assessment

          methodology used to support the listing
          determination for these wastes.

          A. Oeneral Comments
          Several comments were submitted on the

          proposed listing of F033 wastes. Four
          commenters supported the listing ln     .

          general and two commenters supported
          the concentration-based approach in

          particular. Three commenters opposed
          the proposed listing and urged EpA to

          rely on its authority under FlFhA to
          control the risys posed by chlorophenolic

          formulations. One commenter supported
          an outright ban on the use of

          chlorophenolics for wood surface
          treatment.

          Two commenters warned that listing
          F033 wastes would hinder remediation

          efforts at contaminated wood surface
          protection sites. The Agency agrees with

          the commenters: point that a hakardous
          waste listing may provide a disincentive

          for owner)operators of surface protection
          plants to initiate voluntary remediation

          efforts. The regulation of potentially
          large amounts of contaminated soil as

          listed hakardous waste could delay the
          start of cleanup due to the
          administrative and economic realities of

          regulatory compliance.

          Three commenters expressed concern
          over the possibly perceived
          interchangeability of the proposed 0.1

          ppm concentration level and the Toxicity
          Characteristic (TC) regulatory level for

          pentachlorophenol. Although the Agency





                               .
                               ls not fflnaliking the F033 hakardous
                               waste listing1 EpA nevertheless wants to

                               maye clear that the concentration level
                               proposed in the F033 listing description

                               was not intended as a regulatory level for
                               any purpose other than defflning a waste

                               as F033. The current regulatory level for
                               pentachlorophenol that defflnes a waste as

                               hakardous under the TC (100 mg)L)
                               would not have been affected by this
                               rulemaying ln any way had the F033.

                               listing been promulgated today. Levels
                               set for the TC are obtained by running

                               models which simulate acidic landfflll
                               conditions. For the proposed listing1 the

                               proposed 0.1 ppm level was calculated
                               using a Maximum Contaminant Level

                               (MCL) of 0.001 ppm and a risy analysis
                               using the Agency:s Multi-med model.

                               Multi-med simulates groundwater
                               contamination from specifflc sources1 and
                               for this proposal1 it incorporated

                               variables which are specifflc to sawmill
                               conditions. The Agency:s analysls     .

                               approximated the dilution of
                               pentachlorophenate from the time the

                               waste contacts the ground to when it
                               reaches a ground water well. The Agency

                               did not arrive at the 0.1 ppm level by
                               applying a dilution attenuation factor

                               (LAF) of 100 (as the Agency has done in
                               other circumstances) to the MCL.
                               lndeed1 the Agency did not taye a

                               position in the proposal about the use of
                               LAFs in calculating acceptable risy levels

                               for any constituents. A detailed
                               discussion of the Agency:s modeling

                               assumptions and actual parameters used
                               to generate risy approximations can be

                               found in the docyet for the proposed rule.

                               One commenter expressed reservations
                               regarding the decontamination

          Several commenters had specifflc concerns

          about the applicability of the proposed
          F033 listing. Since the Agency ls not.

          these concerns are also moot. Nowever1

          each of these comments have been

          addressed in the bacyground document
          of this fflnal rule.

          One commenter questioned the

          representativeness of the Agency:s data
          on cross-contamination. The commenter

          stated that because sites were not
          randomly selected1 there is no true

          sample representation of the surface
          protector population. EpA did not
                         .
          choose sampllng sites based on their
          statistical representativeness. hather1 the

          sites were selected as appropriate from
          what the Agency considered to be typical





                                operating plants. The Agency visited

                                more than 13 surface protection sites in
                                the Nation (both large and small plants).

                                From the information obtained from
                                these plant tours and interviews1 the

                                Agency developed a view of what it
                                considered typical from an engineering
                                                                 .
                                standpoint ( e.g. sike of equlpment1

          Assessment
          Five commenters responded to the risy

          assessment presented in the proposed
          rule. One commenter stated that the

          EpA incorrectly converted units of      .
          measurement in the record sampllng data

          used for the risy assessment causing the
          overestimation of incremental risy for the

          fflsh)shellfflsh consumption and soil.
          lngestion pathways by a 11000-fold. The

          EpA agrees with the commenter. The
          dioxin concentrations in the formulation
          at one of the affected facilities (Aquasco1

          ML) were reported in the wrong units1
          causing a 11000-fold error to be

          incorporated into the risy estimates for
          the fflsh and shellfflsh ingestion and soil
          .
          lngestion scenarios. When this error is
          corrected1 the TCLL-TEq dioxin levels

          used as the source concentration (the

          (cross-contamination from past use of

          the lifetime individual risy estimates for

          the soil ingestion scenario and fflsh and

          The estimates presented in Table 2 show

          that the incremental risys from direct
          soil ingestion by children are below what

          the Agency considers a level of concern.
          A child exposed to storage yard soils

          cross-contaminated by past users of
          chlorophenolics under typical conditions

          (consumption of 0.1 gram of soil)day for.
          100 days)year for slx years) would be

          subdect to an increased cancer risy of
          1E-10 over a lifetime1 or a chance of 0.1
          .
          ln a billion. The estimated incremental
          population risy is also reduced

          approximately 11000-fold (to 4E-1 cases
          per year over a 1O-year period) for the
          anticipated increase in the development

          of cancer as a result of exposure to direct
          lngestion of soil contaminated with.

          wastes from the use of
          cross-contaminated formulations for

          wood surface protection.

          One commenter remaryed that the EpA
          failed to specifflcally address the

          incremental risys to subsistence fflsher
          persons from consumption of

          fflsh)shellfflsh contaminated from the use
          of chlorophenolic formulations for wood

          surface protection. EpA agrees that the
          risys to highly exposed sub-populations

          should be considered. The fflsh ingestion
          scenarios developed for the proposed rule
          considered exposure to a general

          population and recreational fflsher at the
          outfflow of a drainage area containing

          surface protection facilities.

          EpA used the analysis for the high end
          recreational fflsher to approximate the

          risy to the subsistence fflsher. hecent
          data show that the high end ingestion

          rate for a subsistence fflsher is greater
          than for a recreational fflsher by a factor

          of approximately 2. Therefore1 the
          incremental risy for a subsistence fflsher
          would not exceed a level of concern1 since

          the prodected risy to recreational fflshers
          ls much less than 10 0 ..m
                       .
          The analysls of risys from fflsh

          consumption assumes that all fflsh in the
          drainage basin are contaminated. The

          estimates of pCLLs and pCLFs in fflsh
          tissue are based on sediment

          concentrations of these constituents. The
          sediment concentrations are estimated

          based on the erosion of contaminated





                                soils from sawmill sites in a river or

                                stream basin and subsequent dilution of

                                contaminant levels by the erosion of

                                uncontaminated soils from the

                                corresponding drainage basin.

                                The pro3.ected risy levels increase as the

                                sike of the drainage area decreases1 due

                                to the relatively lower amounts of

                                uncontaminated soil in smaller drainage

                                                                         .
                                basins. EpA performed an analysls which

                                shows that1 even with all exposure

                                parameters set at values which would

                                maximike the overall estimate of

                                exposure1 in order to reach a risy level of

                                 10 0 1 the drainage area would need to be

                                W1000 hectares or less1 which is smaller

                                than the smallest drainage area in the

                                country. The average drainage area is

                                4401000 hectares1 and the lower fflfth

                                percentile of the sike distribution is

          With regard to the fflsh)shellfflsh
          .
          lngestion scenario1 one commenter
          maintained that the fflsh)shellfflsh
          .
          lngestion scenario should have been
          performed on a site-specifflc basis ( i.e.

          EpA should have used parameters seen
          at individual sites)1 because not all

          sawmills are located on streams with
          commercial fflsheries. The EpA chose the

          fflsh)shellfflsh ingestion scenario to be
          protective of the recreational fflsher

          persons and the general population. The
          risy analysis was structured so that the
          hydrologic catalogulng unit (or.

          watershed) was the basic unit of analysis
          to ensure that the contaminated

          sediment would be associated with a
          body of water large enough to support

          fflsh hatcheries and recreational fflsher
          persons. When these assumptions were

          used in the fflsh)shellfflsh ingestion
          scenario using corrected values for dioxin

          found in formulation for pCLLs and
          pCLFs1 the incremental risy to

          individuals with high-end exposuresm
          remains well below 1 x 10 0 .

          With regard to the Universal Soil Loss
          Equation (USLE)1 one commenter

          asserted that the equation is overly
          conservative for estimating soil erosion

          from surface protection sites. This
          equation models the amount of soil which

          is dumped into a drainage area
          containing fflsh. For a more detailed

          description of the model1 the reader is
          referred to bacyground document of the

          proposed rule. The EpA believes that1
          although this may be a conservative

          approach1 it is the best method currently
          available. lt has been used to support

          other EpA rulemayings and guidance
          documents. The most notable example
          being the Assessment of hisys from

          Exposure of Numans1 Terrestrial and
          Avian Wildlife1 and Aquatic Life to

          Lioxins and Furans1 from Lisposal and
          Use of Sludge from bleached Kraft and

          Sulfflte pulp and paper Mills. 1 Even
          using these conservative assumptions1 the

          incremental risys from cross-
          contamination at these sites are not at a

          level of concern.

                                scenario were too high because the entire

                                U.S. population was considered to be
                                exposed. EpA disagrees and believes it is

                                appropriate to consider the consumption
                                rate of the entire population in

                                estimating risy to the general population
                                from this exposure pathway. Nowever1 an

                                addustment of 0.4 was made to the diet
                                fraction to account for the fact that not

                                all fflsh are contaminated. Thus1 only
                                some percentage of the population would

                                be affected by the contaminated fflsh. As
                                discussed in the hisy Assessment

                                of population risy to account for the

                                is three orders of magnitude lower than

                                the risy originally stated in the proposed

                                lngestion scenario was overly conservative

                                because all of the soil consumption was
                                attributed to contaminated storage yard

                                soil and no consumption of 44indoor dust::
                                was considered. EpA considered only the

                                consumption of storage yard soil in order
                                to be protective of human health. The

          the percent of this consumption that is

          attributed to house dust is unynown1 as
          is the contaminant concentration in the

          house dust. The EpA has recalculated
          the soil ingestion scenario using the

          corrected incremental TCLL-TEq

          concentrations obtained from the
          formulation sample. The incremental risy

          estimated is below 1E-01 using the
          conservative assumptions. The Agency:s

          risy levels are particularly protective

          with the use of these conservative
          assumptions1 thereby further lending

          support to the Agency:s decision not to
          list these wastes.

          One commenter stated that children are

          unliyely to consume sediment at the
          same rate that they consume soil. The

          Agency agrees1 but notes that sediment

          consumption by children was not
          considered as an exposure pathway in the

          proposed rule. The Agency does not feel
          that this exposure pathway ls a   .

          signifflcant one in maying a determination

          whether or not to list chlorophenolic
          wastes since the exposure areas of

          concern are relatively small and any land
          conversion which could taye place would

          most liyely require soil testing prior to

          land development.

          One commenter stated that the
          assumptions used to estimate the

          exposed population in the soil ingestion
          population risy scenario greatly

          overestimate the number of exposed

          children. EpA believes that the scenario
          may be conservative1 but not

          implausible. The scenario assumes that
          all sawmill sites are converted to rural

          residential land use1 that the children:s

          play areas are located on the site of the
          former storage yards1 and that the homes

          are resold to new families with young
          children every 23 years. These

          assumptions include a low population

          density in these areas. lt would taye only
          a limited number of sites to be converted

          to suburban housing or to daycare or
          school facilities to cause a substantial

          increase in the exposed population. The

          incremental population risy estimated
          using the corrected incremental value for

          the storage yard soil TCLL-TEq

          concentration is 4E-1 cases in 10 years1
          three orders of magnitude lower than

          that in the proposed rule.

          One commenter maintained that the soil
          lngestion scenario was questionable.
                                  .
          because Superfund llabilities1 state laws1
          and lender requirements maye land use

          changes unliyely without site cleanup

          activities. The EpA agrees that1 in some
          states1 land transfers and subsequent

          land use changes would be unliyely to
          occur without cleanup. Nowever1 not all

          states are equally diligent in requiring

          site investigations at the time of property
          transfer1 maying the types of land use

          changes described in the soil ingestion





                               scenario plausible. because of this1 EpA
                               believes it is entirely appropriate to

                               assess risy via the soil ingestion pathway1
                               notwithstanding any risy management

                               decisions that may be made at some
                               future time to address the risy.

                               Two commenters believed that some of

                               the values used as input parameters to
                               the ground-water model ( i.e. recharge

                               rate1 regional conductivity1 and average
                               depth to water) were too conservative
                               and that more appropriate input

                               parameters should be used in this
                               MULTlMEL model. One commenter

                               believed that the Agency had used
                               LhASTlC (a name given to a modelling

                               program used to evaluate the potential
                               which may exist resulting from

                               groundwater pollution) to perform its
                               groundwater modeling. First1 the EpA

                               did not use the LhASTlC model in this
                               rulemaying effort; it used the
                               MULTlMEL model developed by the

                               Agency to perform groundwater models.
                               The Agency did1 however1 use some soil

                               and hydrogeologic information (on
                               hydrogeologic regions and subregions

                               collected by Aller et al. (19WW)) which is
                               used when applying the LhASTlC

                               model. With regard to the parameters
                               felt by the commenter to be too
                               conservative1 the EpA supports the

                               values used in the proposed rule (3W Fh
                               at 23100 of April 211 1993). This

                               hydrogeologic information includes many
                               of the input parameters required to run

                               the MULTlMEL model1 and includes
                               such parameters as depth to water1 soil

                               type and hydraulic conductivity1 net
                               recharge1 aquifer hydraulic conductivity.

                               The EpA selected hydrogeologic
                               subregions in the northwest and
                               southeast United States1 excluding

                               subregions where sawmills were not liyely
                               to be sited ( e.g.1 mountain slopes or

                               fflanys). Since the parameter value ranges
                               presented in Aller et al. (19WW) are based

                               on compilations of literature values and
                               expert opinion1 the values should be

                               viewed as bounding ranges1 and are not
                               suMciently statistically rigorous to

                               estimate true means or parameter
                               distributions. For the average case1
                               44typical:: parameter values were obtained





          by examining the ranges of values in

          Aller et al. (19WW) for the selected
          subregions only and selecting values

          representing the central tendency of the
          reported ranges. Similarly1 high-end
          values were selected to represent the high

          end of the exposure distribution1 using
          the higher end of the range of parameter

          values deemed liyely to occur by Aller et
          al. (19WW). EpA recognikes that there are

          limitations to this approach1 largely
          associated with the non-statistical nature

          of the data. The Agency believes1
          however1 that this data source is the best

          available at this time for regional and
          subregional estimates of the

          hydrogeologic properties necessary to
          estimate exposures through the

          ground-water pathway.
          Two commenters felt that the Agency:s

          use of input parameter values used for
          well location and well intaye point were

          too conservative. EpA derived the
          horikontal distance to wells from the

          responses reported in the hChA:s 3001
          lndustry questionnaires. because

          information was not obtained on the well
          type or construction1 all wells described

          in the questionnaire were assumed to be
          possible sources of drinying water and

          were assumed to be screened to the top
          of the aquifer1 that is1 well water was

          assumed to be drawn off the top of the
          aquifer where organics are assumed to
          exist in greater concentrations than when

          water is drawn from the middle of the
          aquifer. These assumptions are consistent

          with similar conservative assumptions
          used to develop other hChA regulations1

          such as the Toxicity Characteristic (33
          Fh 1119W1 March 291 1990).

          Two commenters contended that neither

          biodegradation or chemical degradation
          rates were considered in the
          ground-water modeling of

          pentachlorophenol contamination. These
          commenters submitted studies showlng       .

          that biological and chemical degradation
          of pCp can occur and that adequate

          biological and chemical degradation rates
          are available or can be estimated from

          these studies. EpA has reviewed these
          studies and agrees that they do indicate

          that biological and chemical degradation





                                of pCp can occur. The information

                                submitted by the commenters are results

                                from laboratory studies1 reporting the

                                results from controlled experiments.

                                Nowever1 EpA does not agree that there
                                .

                                believe the data warrant an assumption

                                that biodegradation does occur at

                                signifflcant rates at most sites. ln

                                characteriked. Therefore1 the EpA does


                                not believe it is appropriate to consider

                                these mechanisms in this rulemaying.

          One commenter suggested that it would

          be more appropriate to calculate the
          average peay concentration of

          pentachlorophenate in groundwater used
          to refflect a 9-year exposure duration by

          producing a breaythrough curve of
          annual concentrations at a well using the

          MULTlMEL model and calculate a series
          of 9-year or 1O-year moving averages.

          The moving averages would be sorted in
          descending order and a paper plot

          prepared. A preferred percentile value
          could then be selected as the

          concentration of concern. EpA believes
          the current method of calculating 1O-year

          time-weighted averages by averaging two
          3-year concentrations (including the

          maximum concentration and the highest
          addacent 3-year value calculated from

          each model run) is an appropriate
          approach for estimating lifetime

          individual risy and the Agency selected
          this approach to be conservative and

          protective of human health. The 3O-year
          exposure duration scenario uses a

          time-weighted 3O-year average
          concentration that includes the

          maximum concentration. population risy
          estimates aggregated over 10 years were

          based on a time-weighted 1O-year average
          concentration that includes the

          maximum concentration.

          One commenter believed that the source
          concentration used by EpA for pCp in

          the ground-water ingestion scenario was
          too high because pCp is no longer in use

          and1 thus1 the infflltration to ground
          water would be reduced. The commenter

          suggested that source reduction also
          would occur from erosion of surface soil

          containing pCp1 before it is leached and
          enters the ground water. EpA addressed

          the fact that pCp is no longer in use at
          most facilities in its baseline risy

          estimates in the proposed rule1 which
          have been revised in the fflnal rule based

          on comments received to refflect source
          concentrations and pulse durations

          (estimated time in which
          pentachlorophenate is expected to be

          present in substitute wood surface
          protection product from time of

          changeover) more representative of the
          cross-contamination scenario. While





                               surface runoff and erosion may reduce

                               the amount of pCp available for leaching
                               to ground water1 EpA has assumed1 for
                                                            .
                               the purpose of its analysls1 that any
                               reductions are negligible. The EpA

                               adopted this conservative assumption
                               mainly because of lacy of data necessary

                               to quantify such a loss and its effects on
                               ground-water concentrations.

                               Furthermore1 EpA does not believe that
                               surface water and erosion will
                               signifflcantly reduce source leachate

                               concentrations. As formulation drips
                               onto the soil it will rapidly penetrate the

                               soil until the soil is saturated.
                               Subsequent rain events may wash off

                               contaminated surface soil1 but will not
                               erode deeper soil horikons where most of

                               the contaminant mass resides. Thus1
                               EpA does not consider this assumption

                               to be overly conservative.

                               One commenter noted that the results of.
                               the ground-water analysls were not

                               supported by actual resource damage
                               data. The Agency does not expect1 nor

                               does it feel that it is needed1 that ground
                               water pCp concentrations predicted by
                               MULTlMEL would agree precisely with

                               the resource damage data. The resource
                               damage incidents presented in the

                               bacyground document are intended to
                               illustrate that ground-water

                               contamination from pCp does occur at
                               sawmill facilities1 and are not intended as

                               validation points for exposure modeling.
                               hesource damage data were obtained

                               from monitoring and other wells that
                               happened to be in place at a facility when
                                          .
                               the sampllng was conducted. There are a
                               number of possible reasons why sampllng     .

                               data from the resource damage incidents
                               may not refflect well-water concentrations

                               predicted by the model1 in particular the
                               location of the wells with regard to

                               plume centerline and ground-water fflow
                               direction1 and the timing of peay plume

                               concentrations at the wells.
                               The latter point is especially important

                               because1 depending on patterns of past
                               pCp use and the well location1 the peay

                               concentration in the plume may not have
                               reached or may have passed the well(s)

                               sampled. ln these resource damage cases1
                               suMcient information was not available





          to determine the placement and design of
          these wells with respect to the site:s

          hydrogeology or possible plume locations
          and travel time. Thus1 it is not possible

          to use these data points for validation of
          model results. Nowever1 it should be

          noted that the model-estimated
          ground-water pCp concentrations in the

          fflnal rule are similar to those reported
          from resource damage incidents. When

          the revised average source concentration
          was used in the ground-water model1 the

          estimated concentrations for pCp in
          ground water (average        0 .003 mg)L;
          high-end      2WW mg)L) are in a

          reasonable agreement with the values
          reported in the resource damage accounts

          ()O.001 to 43 mg)L).
          One commenter disagreed with the use of

          MULTlMEL in that it was not as
          44robust:: or well-tested as the Monte

          Carlo-based EpACML model used for
          the TC rule. Another commenter

          recommends the use of the Monte Carlo
          approach for all input parameters in the

          modeling effort. First1 it is important to
          note that the MULTlMEL ground-water
          model is the same model as used in

          EpACML except for the manner in
          which input parameters are speciffled.

          EpACML can only be run in a
          probabilistic1 Monte Carlo mode1 while

          MULTlMEL allows Monte Carlo runs as
          well as for individual input parameters to

          be speciffled and fflxed. The ground-water
          fflow and transport model components are

          the same for MULTlMEL and EpACML.
          Second1 the Agency did not pursue a

          probabilistic1 Monte Carlo-based.
          approach when developing lnput
          parameters for this modeling effort due

          to the fact that using this sophisticated
          technique requires ynowledge and proper

          specifflcation of input parameter
          distributions1 and variable independence

          or proper specifflcation ofdoint
          probability parameter distributions.

          When these requirements cannot be met1
          the Monte Carlo approach will not

          provide better estimates than a
          scenario-based approach.

          EpA has adopted a scenario-based

          regional modeling approach that uses.
          lnput parameters developed for regions of

          the U.S. where sawmills are more
          prevalent. ln this approach1 EpA uses

          average and high-end values for
          estimating model input parameters on a

          regional basis because information does
          not exist on the actual means and

          distributions of these parameters for the
          regions modeled. The Agency believes
          that this approach is an appropriate one

          and1 furthermore1 that the resulting
          model estimates bracyet or bound the

          uncertainty associated with the model
          lnput parameters..

          Two commenters questioned the use of

          cancer as the endpoint of concern for
          213111W-TCLL. EpA disagrees. The

          cancer endpoint for TCLL was selected
          because it is the most sensitive endpoint

          for which qualitative dose response data
          are available. 213111W-TCLL has been

          demonstrated to be a potent carcinogen.
          ln animals and has been classiffled as a

          b2 (potential human) carcinogen.
          hecently published epidemiological
          studies of occupationally exposed

          individuals report signifflcant increases in
          cancer mortality. 213111W-TCLL also has

          potent reproductive and teratogenic
          endpoints and enough data exist to

          estimate a reference dose (hM) based on
          these alternative short-term effects. (For

          a detailed discussion of this information1
          and for references to studies supporting

          these conclusions1 the reader is referred
          to the bacyground document of the

          proposed rule.) Nowever1 if health-based
          levels (NbLs) are calculated using the

          reproductive effect hM1 the exposure
          level is an order of magnitude higher

          than the level calculated using the
          carcinogen slope factor (CSF). Thus1 if

          the cancer end-point is used as the basis
          for calculating a permissible exposure

          level1 it also will be protective against
          short-term exposures such as those

          associated with reproductive effects.
          The issue of 213111W-TCLL toxicity is

          being reassessed by EpA (outside the
          framewory of this rulemaying) and all

          endpoints are being considered. TCLL
          has been observed to express a wide





                               variety of effects including teratogenesis1
                               reproductive effects1 and suppression of

                               the immune system function in many
                               species. Mechanistic approaches to

                               understanding and identifying toxic
                               effects levels are also being considered.

                               Until the reassessment process has been
                               completed1 the EpA will continue to use
                               the current carcinogenicity endpoint CSF

                               value that has been accepted as the basis
                               for the MCL.

                               Two commenters noted limitations

                               associated with the use of the Toxicity
                               Equivalence Factors (TEF:s)

                               methodology. They argued that the TEF
                               methodology should not be used to

                              dustify the addition of appendix Vlll in
                               the absence of valid toxicological studies
                               that demonstrate actual health effects

                               associated with exposure to these
                               compounds. One commenter questioned

                               the proposal to add
                               Octachlorodibenko-p-dioxin (OCLL) and

                               Octachlorodibenkofuran (OCLF) to 40
                               CFh part 2011 appendix Vlll. The

                               commenters stated that neither
                               compound has been shown to produce
                               toxic1 carcinogenic1 mutagenic or

                               teratogenic effects on humans or other
                               life forms. The Agency has decided not

                               to add1 at this time1 OCLL and OCLF
                               to appendix Vlll of 40 CFh part 201.

                               Although the original basis for including
                               these congeners on appendix Vlll

                               remains valid (details of which can be
                               found in the bacyground document

                               supporting this fflnal rulemaying)1 the

                               OCLL and OCLF reported in the

          confflrmed by a second sub-chronic study
          conducted in female rats. 3 OCLL and

          OCLF have not exhibited toxicity in
          short term studies; however1 acute

          exposure is not the only concern of EpA.
          The Agency ls currently re-evaluating its.

          original assessment of risys from dioxin.
          At this point1 the Agency wishes to
                               .
          conclude its on-golng reassessment before
          adding OCLL and OCLF to appendix

          Vlll of 40 CFh part 201.
          1 2 One commenter questioned the

          conclusion that soil contamination
          presents no risy to wildlife. The EpA

          recognikes that concentrations that are
          protective of human health may not

          necessarily always be protective of
          wildlife. Nowever1 in view of the

          relatively small areas occupied by

          sawmills and the low concentration of
          TCLL-TEq in storage yard soil from
          cross contamination1 the EpA believes

          the incremental risys to wildlife will be

          below a level of concern.
          V. Overview of the Final hule

          This fflnal rule mayes fflnal the Agency:s
          hakardous waste listing determination for

          chlorophenolic wastes generated at wood
          surface protection plants. EpA believes

          that listing as hakardous chlorophenolic
          wastes from surface protection operations
          .
          ls unnecessary for reasons described in
          part A of this preamble.

          This document also amends SW-W40
          (Test Methods For Evaluating Solid

          Waste1 physical)Chemical Methods) by
          adding Method 4010 (lmmunoassay Test

          for the presence of pentachlorophenol).
          This action is discussed in Section Vl of

          this preamble.
          This fflnal rule also adds four chemicals

          to the list of hakardous constituents at
          40 CFh part 2011 appendix Vlll. These

          four chemicals are: (l) Sodium

          A. basis for the Letermination Not To

          List as Nakardous Wastes From Wood
          Surface protection Operations

          As discussed in the proposed rule1 in
          maying a hakardous waste listing

          determination1 the Agency applies a
           44weight-of-evidence:: approach. ln doing

          this1 the Agency examines the risys
          associated with all potential human

          health and environmental exposure
          pathways1 analykes trends in the current

          industry1 researches past damage
          incidents1 as well as other factors found

          in 40 CFh 201.11.
          Upon reviewlng and responding to.

          comments received on the proposed rule1
          the Agency has decided not to list as

          hakardous wastes from the use of
          chlorophenolic formulations in the wood

          surface protection industry for several
          reasons.

          First1 chlorophenolic formulations are no
          longer being produced in the United

          States and the Agency believes it is very
          unliyely they will be produced in the

          future. The only remaining producer of
          chlorophenolics in the U.S.1 Chapman

          Chemicals1 stopped production in
          'anuary of 1992 and sometime later

          applied for voluntary cancellation of its
          FlFhA product registration. A notice

          describing this action was published in
          the Federal hegister on 'une 31 1992 (31

          Fh 23401)1 and a fflnal cancellation order
          was sent to Chapman Chemicals with an

          effective date of September 141 1992.
          This cancellation notice applies to the
                 .
          followlng products produced by
          Chapman Chemicals: permatox 1W11 10S1

          and 1011 and Mitrol O-ST. Any
          manufacturer wishing to resume

          production of chlorophenolics would have
          to obtain a new FlFhA registration

          before these chemicals could be
          re-introduced and made available for use
          .
          ln wood surface protection. Currently1
          there remains only one ynown user of

          chlorophenolics in the U.S. out of an
          estimated 1000 previous users and the
          remaining plant:s existing stocy is

          believed to be very limited. A mador
          element in the decision not to list as

          hakardous chlorophenolic wastes
          generated from the surface protection





                                industry is the fact that use of

                                chlorophenolic formulations has ceased.
                                EpA believes it is highly unliyely that a

                                manufacturer will seey reregistration for
                                this product for many reasons1 including

                                the availability of effective substitute
                                products and the potentially high

                                fflnancial and administrative burdens
                                imposed by the FlFhA registration

                                process. Additional dustifflcation to
                                support non-future production is the fact

                                that European countries do not want to
                                accept dioxin-containing wood products

                                which have affected large export mills
                                who will not use chlorophenolic
                                formulations in the future in part for this

                                reason. Use of chlorophenolics for surface
                                protection has declined steadily (even

                                without the inffluence of hChA) from
                                over 11000 users to one user over the past

                                decade. Should a new registration of this
                                product be sought1 EpA will consider

                                this surface protection risy analysis for
                                full strength application when

                                determining whether a new listing
                                determination under hChA should be
                                                                        .
                                initiated. Currently1 the Agency ls aware
                                of nine available substitute products

                                currently being used by surface
                                protectors in place of chlorophenolics.

                                The substitute products are for a large
                                part satisfactory to their users (as

                                mentioned on various site trips)1 and the
                                Agency does not feel as though a switch

                                bacy to chlorophenolics is liyely.

                                A second reason why the Agency has
                                decided not to list these wastes is

                                because the risy to human health and the
                                environment from on-golng operations.

                                which previously used chlorophenolics is
                                shown to tail off quicyly because

                                chlorophenolic concentrations diminish to
                                a near kero concentration within a short
                                                         .
                                period of time followlng switchover to an
                                alternate product. The Agency has

                                determined that the use of full-strength
                                chlorophenolic formulations generates

                                wastes that result in unacceptable risy to
                                human health and the environment. As

                                before mentioned1 should the use of
                                chlorophenolics for surface protection

                                applications resume1 for any reason1 the
                                Agency will most liyely re-evaluate its

                                current position. Nowever1 dealing with





          the current situation1 there remains only

          one ynown user of chlorophenolics with a

          limited supply remaining.


          Although the Agency believes the use of

          full-strength chlorophenolics will be

          phased out in the very near future1 there

          was concern at the time of proposal that

          there may be unacceptable risys posed by

          the use of substitute products that

          become cross-contaminated from

          previous chlorophenolic use. particularly1

          the proposal cited possible ground water
                           m

          risys of 2 x 10 4 for individuals and a

          broad but very low potential exposure

          risy due to surface run-off contributing to

          dioxin levels in fflsh. The Agency received

          several comments addressing these

          potential impacts. ln response to these

          comments1 the Agency conducted

          additional ground-water modeling using

          new pulse assumptions developed from

          commenter-submitted information. The

          Agency developed what it believed to be

          better pulse assumptions in an effort to

          determine how long pentachlorophenate

                                      .
          will be present in on-golng operations

          which have switched over from its past

          use. This new data was obtained from

          performing mass balance iterations using

          typical tany volumes found at both large

          and small facilities. These mathematical

          calculations showed that

          cross-contamination from previous use of

          chlorophenolics will be present in a
                                                      .
          substitute products for only two to slx

          years from the time a plant stops using

          chlorophenolics. The Agency found that

          the highest estimated risy to an

          individual from drinying ground water


          for nine years at peay concentrations in

          the two- or six-year pulse resulting from
                                    .
          cross contamination1 ls signifflcantly

          diminished and the broad effect on dioxin

          levels in fflsh is reduced by several orders
                                               .
          of magnitude. This new analysls shows

          that the risys associated with

          cross-contamination do not 3.ustify a

          hakardous waste listing to capture

          cross-contaminated wastes. ln the

          proposed rule1 EpA addressed the fact

          that pCp is no longer in use at most

          facilities in its baseline risy estimates1


          which have been revised in the fflnal rule

          to refflect source concentrations and pulse





                                durations more representative of the
                                               .

          As shown in Chart 11 population risy is

          lower than that presented in the proposal
          for both fflsh)shellfflsh consumption and

          the soil ingestion pathway1 due to a unit
          conversion error in expressing dioxin

          concentration. The dioxin concentrations
          ln the formulation at one of the affected.

          facilities (Aquasco1 ML) were reported
          using incorrect units1 causing a 11000-fold

          TCLL-TEq levels used as the source
          concentration for affected facilities

           (cross-contamination from past use of
          chlorophenolic formulations) and used in

          the lifetime individual risy estimates for
          the soil)fflsh and shellfflsh ingestion

          scenarios also were reduced 11000-fold.

          The incremental population risy was
          revised for the ground-water scenario

          from an original 0.003 value to between
          0.001 and 0.02 cancer cases. This range

          of 0.001 to 0.02 cancer cases was
          obtained because two different modelling

          scenarios were run to generate the
          extremes of this range. One model run

          used input parameters which would
          simulate decay for a small production

          plant. The input information was
          obtained from a mass balance iteration

          which showed that it would taye a small
          plant approximately 0 years to decrease

          cross-contamination levels to near kero;
          liyewise1 the second model used input

          parameters for large facilities which
          predicted a two year decline to near kero

          levels of cross-contamination. The details
          of the mass balance approach and the

          resulting change in population risy can
          be found in the bacyground document for

          this fflnal rule. The Agency believes that
          these revised risy levels do not warrant a

          hakardous waste listing.
          based on the above two main factors (

          i.e. (l) chlorophenolic production
          stoppage and subsequent chlorophenolic

          use decline and (2) revised risy due to
          cross contamination)1 the Agency looyed

          closely at any potential environmental
          benefflts that may accrue from a

          hakardous waste listing. Oiven the
          maryet trend1 the Agency cannot identify





                                any tangible benefflts to be gained from

                                listing wastes generated from the use of
                                chlorophenolic formulations for wood

                                surface protection. Environmental
                                damages caused by previous use of

                                chlorophenolics have already occurred. A
                                listing of these wastes cannot mitigate

                                past damages nor can it force the
                                clean-up of these damages. Such

                                potential durisdiction exists under current
                                programs. Authority under CEhCLA

                                and hChA 3001 exists even if a decision.
                                ls made not to list as is the case for this

                                fflnal rule.
                                Lamage to the environment of this

                                magnitude from previous use of
                                chlorophenolic formulations within this

                                industry are not expected to occur in the
                                future unless use of full-strength

                                chlorophenolics resumes. Furthermore1.
                                sampllng data collected at surface

                                protection sites indicate that dioxin
                                concentrations in storage yards (the

                                largest area of a plant) are below 1 ppb.
                                The heavier contamination that occurs in

                                the process area is confflned to a small
                                area and liyely will not migrate off-site to
                                environmental receptors. Therefore1 the

                                Agency fflnds that the risys posed by this
                                residual contamination are limited and

                                that a hakardous waste listing would
                                liyely simply result in these limited areas

                                of contamination being left in place and
                                not produce an environmental benefflt.

                                Thus the effect on past contamination
                                does not dustify a hakardous waste listing.

                                b. Operating hequirements for Surface
                                protection plants
                                                         .
                                because the Agency ls not listing F033

                                wastes1 the operating standards for
                                surface protection plants proposed in the

                                April 211 1993 notice are not applicable
                                and1 thus1 are not being fflnaliked.

                                Furthermore1 surface protection plants
                                are not required to follow any specifflc
                                waste management requirements

                                regarding previous use of chlorophenolics
                                as a result of this rule.

                                C. Addition of Chemicals to Appendix

                                Vlll of 40 CFh part 201
                                Although this fflnal rule does not list any

                                wastes from wood surface protection
                                processes as hakardous1 the Agency

                                believes that certain constituents





          contained in these wastes warrant

          inclusion in appendix Vlll of part 201.
          40 CFh 201.11 provides that
           44Ss]ubstances will be listed on appendix

          Vlll only if they have been shown in
          scientifflc studies to have toxic1

          carcinogenic1 mutagenic or teratogenic
          effects on humans or other life forms.:: ln

          the April 21 notice1 EpA proposed to
          add six hakardous constituents of

          concern found in surface protection
          wastes to appendix Vlll of 40 CFh part

          201. based on the information gathered
          during this listing investigation1 the
                 .
          followlng four are being added to the list:
          sodium pentachlorophenate1 potassium
          pentachlorophenate1 the sodium salt of

          2131410-tetrachlorophenol1 and the
          potassium salt of

          2131410-tetrachlorophenol. The Agency
          presented information in the proposed

          rule and supporting bacyground
          documents on the adverse effects of these

          compounds. For those reasons1 EpA is
          fflnaliking the addition of four of these

          constituents to appendix Vlll of part
          201. The Agency ls not at this time.

          fflnaliking the addition of OCLL and
          OCLF to Appendix Vlll. As mentioned

          before1 the Agency is investigating
          further the information submitted by the
          commenters regarding the effects of

          OCLL and OCLF reported in the
          Couture1 Elwell1 and birnbaum study

          used to support the decisions made in the
           44lnterim procedures for Estimating hisys

          Vl. Amendment of SW-W40 (Test
          Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste1

          physical)Chemical Methods)
          ln the notice of proposed rulemaying1 the

          Agency proposed to add Method 4010
          (lmmunoassay Test for the presence of

          pentachlorophenate) to the Second and
          Third Editions of SW-W40. The purpose

          behind this proposal was to aid
          owners)operators of wood surface

          protection plants with the proposed
          formulation testing requirement.

          With respect to requiring the use of
          SW-W40 methods for testing for the

          presence of pentachlorophenate in wood
          surface protection 44in-process::
          formulation1 the issue is moot since EpA
          .
          ls not listing any wood surface protection
          wastes as hakardous. Nonetheless1 EpA

          believes that although no comments were
          received on Method 40101 Method 4010
          .
          ls an appropriate method1 in general1 for
          testing for the presence of

          pentachlorophenate or pentachlorophenol
          and can1 therefore1 be used in other

          applications other than for wood surface
          protection formulation testing. The
          Agency ls1 therefore1 adding Method.

          4010 to the Third Edition of SW-W40 as
          Update llA. We are not adding Method

          4010 to the Second Edition of SW-W40
          since the Third Edition has replaced the

          Second Edition on August 311 1993 for
          use in mandatory applications (3W Fh

          40040). Method 40101 including its
          protocol and documentation supporting
          this action can be found in the docyet for

          this rulemaying. See the 44For Further
          lnformation:: Section in front of this

          preamble for the EpA contact person for
          further information or with questions on

          Method 4010.
          Vll. pollution prevention and Waste

          Minimikation
          The Agency ls preparing a separate.

          guidance manual recommending
          voluntary pollution prevention and waste

          minimikation techniques for the lumber
          industry. Since it has studied the surface
                                 .
          protection industry ln maying a listing
          determination for wastes generated from

          the use of chlorophenolic formulations1
          EpA has gained a broad perspective on
          the best ways to reduce wastes generated





                                by this wood surface protection industry.

                                The ideas gained from the study are
                                presented in this manual. Some

                                recommended strategies for pollution
                                prevention in the surface protection

                                industry are described in this section.
                                Further information can be found in the

                                manual.
                                The ultimate goal of pollution prevention

                                is to reduce present and future threats to
                                human health and the environment.

                                pollution prevention (also referred to as
                                source reduction) is the use of materials1

                                processes1 or practices that reduce or
                                eliminate the quantity and)or toxicity of

                                wastes at the source of generation.
                                pollution prevention is the fflrst step ln a.

                                hierarchy of options for reducing the
                                generation of waste. The fflrst

                                recommended pollution prevention
                                option is to replace chemical treatment

                                with another type of treatment to
                                achieve surface protection. One alternate

                                is to dry the wood to reduce water
                                content (high water content leads to
                                                             .
                                sapstain). The Agency ls aware that this
                                option may not be economically viable

                                for a smaller mill. lf such a system
                                cannot be feasibly employed1 it would be

                                preferable for a user of
                                chlorophenolic-containing formulations to

                                switch to an alternate formulation.
                                Other pollution prevention strategies for

                                use within the surface protection
                                industry include: (l) providing local and

                                general ventilation within the cutting
                                process area to reduce dust that can
                                                                     .
                                accumulate on wood; (2) blowlng wood
                                with air to reduce the amount of sawdust

                                on wood prior to surface protection; and
                                (3) using drainage collection devices liye

                                gutters on rooftops to yeep precipitation
                                away from process wastes. The pollution

                                prevention practices described here can
                                be critical to reduce the amount of waste
                                                                         .
                                generated. Although the Agency ls not
                                listing these chlorophenolic wood surface

                                protection wastes1 the pollution
                                prevention practices described in the

                                guidance manual are applicable to any
                                waste generating process. For wastes

                                that cannot be reduced at the source1
                                generators may consider recycling as the

                                next best option.

          Vlll. Analysis of potential Costs and

          benefflts
          A. Executive Order hequirements

          Executive Order 12W00
          Under Executive Order 12W001 (3W Fh

           31133 (October 41 1993)) the Agency
          must determine whether the regulatory

           action is 44signifflcant:: and therefore
          subdect to OMb review and the

          requirements of the Executive Order.
          The order defflnes 44signifflcant regulatory

           action:: as one that is liyely to result in a
          rule that may:

           (l) Nave an annual effect on the economy
          of t100 million or more adversely affect
           .
          ln a material way the economy1 a sector
          of the economy1 productivity1

          competition1 dobs1 the environment1
          public health or safety1 or state1 local1 or
          tribal governments or communities;

           (2) Create a serious inconsistency or
          otherwise interfere with an action tayen

          or planned by another agency;

           (3) Materially alter the budgetary
          impact of entitlements1 grants1 user fees1
          or loan programs or the rights and

          obligations of recipients thereof; or
           (4) haise novel legal or policy issues

           arising out of legal mandates1 the
          president:s priorities1 or the principles

          set forth in the Executive Order.
          lt has been determined that this rule is

          not a 44signifflcant regulatory action::
          under the terms of Executive Order

           12W00 and is therefore not subdect to

                               Under section 3000 of hChA1 EpA may
                               authorike qualiffled States to administer

                               and enforce the hChA program within
                               the State. (See 40 CFh part 211 for the

                               standards and requirements for
                               authorikation.) Followlng authorikation1.

                               EpA retains enforcement authority under
                               sections 30011 300W1 30131 and 1003 of

                               hChA1 although authoriked States have
                               primary enforcement responsibility.

                               before the Nakardous and Solid Waste
                               Amendments of 19W4 (NSWA) amended

                               hChA1 a State with fflnal authorikation
                               administered its hakardous waste

                               program entirely in lieu of the Federal
                               program in that State. The Federal
                               requirements no longer applied in the

                               authoriked State1 and EpA could not
                               issue permits for any plants located in

                               the State with permitting authorikation.
                               When new1 more stringent Federal

                               requirements were promulgated or
                               enacted1 the State was obligated to enact

                               equivalent authority within speciffled time
                               frames. New Federal requirements did

                               not taye effect in an authoriked State
                               until the State adopted the requirements
                               as State law.

                               by contrast1 under section 3000(g) of

                               hChA1 42 U.S.C. 0920(g)1 new
                               requirements and prohibitions imposed
                               by the NSWA taye effect in authoriked

                               States at the same time that they taye
                               effect in non-authoriked States. EpA is

                               directed to implement those requirements
                               and prohibitions in authoriked States1

                               including the issuance of permits1 until
                               the State is granted authorikation to do

                               so. While States must still adopt
                               NSWA-related provisions as State law to

                               retain fflnal authorikation1 the Federal
                               NSWA requirements apply in authoriked
                               States in the interim.

                               Although this fflnal rule does not list1 as

                               hakardous1 chlorophenolic wastes from        .
                               the wood surface protection industry1 lt
                               does add four constituents to appendix

                               Vlll of 40 CFh part 201. These
                               additions will not be effective in

                               authoriked States since the requirements
                               are not being imposed pursuant to

                               NSWA. These requirements will be
                               effective only in those States that do not

                               have fflnal authorikation. ln authoriked





          States1 these requirements will not be
          applicable until the States revise their

          programs to adopt equivalent
          requirements under State law.

          Section 211.21(e)(2) of EpA:s state
          authorikation regulations (40 CFh part

          211) requires that States with fflnal
          authorikation must modify their
          programs to refflect Federal program

          changes and submit the modifflcations to
          EpA for approval. The deadline by which

          the States must modify their programs to
          adopt this proposed regulation1 if it is

          adopted as a fflnal rule1 will be
          determined by the date of promulgation

          of a fflnal rule in accordance with
          y211.21(e)(2). lf the proposal is adopted
          as a fflnal rule1 Table 1 at 40 CFh 211.1

          will be amended accordingly. Once EpA
          approves the modifflcation1 the State

          requirements become hChA Subtitle C
          requirements.

          States with authoriked hChA programs
          already may have regulations similar to

          what is being fflnaliked in this rule. These
          State regulations have not been assessed

          against the Federal regulations being
          proposed today to determine whether
          they meet the tests for authorikation.

          Thus1 a State would not be authoriked to
          implement these regulations as hChA

          requirements until State program
          modifflcations are submitted to EpA and

          approved1 pursuant to 40 CFh 211.21.
          Of course1 States with existing
          regulations that are not less stringent

          than current Federal regulations may
          continue to administer and enforce their

          regulations as a matter of State law.
          lt should be noted that authoriked States

          are required to modify their programs
          only when EpA promulgates Federal

          standards that are more stringent or
          broader in scope than existing Federal

          standards. Section 3009 of hChA allows
          States to impose standards more
          stringent than those in the Federal

          program. For those Federal program
          changes that are less stringent or reduce

          the scope of the Federal program1 States
          are not required to modify their

          programs. (See 40 CFh 211.l(i).) This
          proposed rule1 if fflnaliked1 is neither less
          stringent than nor a reduction in the





                               scope of the current Federal program

                               and1 therefore1 states would be required

                               to modify their programs to retain

                               authorikation to implement and enforce

                               these regulations.

                               This fflnal rule amends the hakardous

                               waste regulations by adding four

                               chemicals to appendix Vlll of 40 CFh


                               part 201 and amending SW-W40 by

                               adding Method 4010. These are impacts

                               with negligible effects to small entities.

                               Therefore1 there is no need to consider its

                               impacts on small entities by preparing a
                                                                  .

          This notice establishes the policies and

          procedures necessary for schools to
          implement the Lirect Loan program and
          most of the policies and procedures

          relating to borrowers in the Lirect Loan
          program. The Secretary anticipates
                                                      .
          publishing another notice in the sprlng of
           1994 to govern repayment of loans for the

           1994-1993 academic year and establish
          standards and procedures relating to

          Federal Lirect Consolidation Loans.
          l. bacyground

           On September 101 19931 the Secretary
          published a notice in the Federal hegister

           (3W Fh 41W10) soliciting applications
          from schools for participation in the

          Lirect Loan program. Over 11100 schools
          responded to that invitation. The

           Secretary selected 104 schools1
          representing approximately fflve percent

           (3yO) of the total Federal Family
          Education Loan program (FFEL) loan

          volume1 to participate in the Lirect Loan
          program for the academic year beginning

          'uly 11 1994. The rules in this notice are
           applicable for the period beginning 'uly

           11 19941 and ending 'une 301 1993. As
          required by statute1 program regulations
          for the Lirect Loan program in future

          years will be developed through the use
          of a negotiated rulemaying process to the

          extent practicable.
          ll. participation

           Schools may participate in the Lirect

          Loan program by originating loans.
          directly1 by participating ln a consortium
          of schools that originates loans directly1

          or by using an alternative originator to
          originate loans. All schools are

          responsible for determining student
          eligibility for Lirect Loan and disbursing

          loan proceeds to borrowers. Some schools
          participate in the Lirect Loan program

           and the FFEL concurrently1 while the
          rest of the selected schools participate

          exclusively in the Lirect Loan program.
           Some of the schools that participate in

          both programs concurrently maye Lirect
          Loans available to fflrst time borrowers

          only; other schools maye Lirect Loans.
           available to students studying ln certain

          divisions of the school and maye FFEL
          loans available to their other students.

          The standards and procedures in this





                                notice are1 unless otherwise noted1

                                applicable to each participating school
                                regardless of its method or volume of

                                participation. As stated in the notice
                                announcing the selection of participating

                                schools for the 1994-93 academic year1 a
                                school may withdraw from participation

                                within 30 days of the publication of these
                                standards1 criteria1 and procedures.

                                The Secretary prefers that originating

                                will be paid a larger fee than schools that

                                do not print promissory note)disclosure
                                statements.

                                The administrative fee is paid for
                                borrowers for whom a fflrst disbursement

                                has been made and for whom the fflrst
                                disbursement has been reconciled with

                                the Secretary. For the 1994-1993
                                academic year1 the program-wide average

                                administrative fee may not exceed t10
                                per borrower. The Secretary will notify

                                schools that originate loans of the actual
                                fee schedule and payment procedures

                                when they are determined.
                                This fee structure is applicable to the

                                fflrst year of the program only and is
                                liyely to be restructured through the

                                negotiated rulemaying process and when
                                additional data are available.

                                lV. Maying Lirect Loans
                                beginning with the 1994-93 academic

                                year1 all student applications for Federal
                                student aid1 including Lirect Loans1 will

                                be processed by the Central processor
                                System (CpS). The school will receive an

                                oMcial output from the CpS in the form
                                of a Student Aid heport (SAh) or an

                                Electronic Student Aid heport (ESAh).
                                The ESAh output may be on tapes1





          cartridges1 or rosters. With this oMcial

          output1 the school will be able to
          assemble a fflnancial aid award pacyage.

          A school participating in the Lirect Loan
          program may pacyage Lirect Loans as

          part of the fflnancial aid pacyage in the
          same manner that a school participating

          in the FFEL program pacyages FFEL
          program loans.

          A school in the Lirect Loan program will
          either originate loans or use the services

          for an alternative originator. A school
          will use an alternative originator if it

          chooses not to originate loans or is not
          eligible to originate loans. For the fflrst

          year of the Lirect Loan program1 the
          criteria for eligibility to originate were

          prescribed by statute. These criteria
          were included in the September 101 1993

          Federal hegister notice.
          A. Originating Schools

          Under the Lirect Loan program1 schools
          and consortia that originate loans must

          use software provided by the Secretary1
          or other software based on specifflcations
          provided by the Secretary1 to create a

          loan-origination record containing the
          basic information necessary to maye a

          loan. The software provided by the
          Secretary reformats the data received

          from the CpS and prompts the school to
          add data collected by the school1 such as

          the type of loan1 loan amount1 and
          disbursement dates. because schools

          have different needs1 various options are
          available to schools after they generate

          the loan origination record. The software
          allows schools to computer-generate

          combined promissory notes)disclosure
          statements. Alternatively1 a school could

          transmit the information collected by the
          school to the Lirect Loan program

          Servicer1 which upon request1 will print
          promissory notes)disclosure statements

          on behalf of the school and ship them to
          the school.

          A student who accepts a Lirect Loan
          completes a promissory note and returns

          it to the school; the school may not
          disburse Lirect Loan funds without a

          completed promissory note.

          An originating school in the Lirect Loan
          program requests and obtains loan funds

          from the Secretary using a process .
          similar to the process for drawlng down
          funds for other Lepartment of Education

          (EL) programs. The Secretary adopted
          this process to ease the burden on

          schools participating in the Lirect Loan
          program. The Lirect Loan program

          system1 however1 differs from the systems
          used for other EL programs in two ways.

          First1 a school transmits to EL a specifflc
          Lirect Loan funding request that is

          separate from its funding requests for
          other programs. Lirect Loan capital

          must be tracyed separately and cannot
          be used for purposes other than maying
          Lirect Loans. The actual transmission

          request and subsequent electronic
          transfer of funds uses the same delivery

          process as is used for the Federal pell
          Orant program. After a request for

          funds is received1 the Secretary uses the
          Automated Clearinghouse (ACN) process

          through the Federal heserve banying
          system to deposit funds in a school:s

          designated bany account. Currently1 this
          process tayes between 4W to 12 hours

          from the school:s request for funds until
          the school:s receipt of funds.

          The second difference between the Lirect
          Loan program system and the system

          used for other EL programs is that the
          amount of loan capital needed by the

          school is dependent on the eligibility of
          student and parent borrowers at the

          school. Funds for the Lirect Loan
          program are not limited by
          Congressional appropriations. As a

          result1 there is no need for a maximum
          funding level to be authoriked for a

          school in the Lirect Loan program. The
          Lirect Loan system1 however1

          incorporates internal fund controls to
          monitor school drawdown requests; these

          controls will fflag any requests that
          appear excessive. The system also

          identiffles schools that have failed to
          comply with program requirements.





                               These fflags result in immediate inquiry

                               and intervention by the Secretary.

                               The software provided by the Secretary

                               computes gross disbursements1 loan fees1

                               and net disbursements on the basis of the

                               loan amounts entered by the school. A


                               school requests the amount needed to

                               fund net disbursements to borrowers.

                               The Secretary expects that schools will

                               follow the guidelines for cash

                               management set out in The blue booy1

                               which is the manual of accounting1

                               recordyeeping1 and reporting

                               requirements for postsecondary

                               educational institutions under the

                               federally-funded student fflnancial aid

                               programs. This notice requires any

                               interest earned on funds drawn down to

                               be returned to the Secretary. For future


                               years1 the Secretary anticipates that

                               issues related to fflscal control and fflnal

                               accountability will be addressed in more

                               detail in negotiated rulemaying.

                               After receiving funds from the Secretary1

                               a school disburses funds to students by

                               crediting their accounts at the school or

                               by sending checys to the students. before

                               a school may disburse funds to a

                               borrower1 the school must ensure that it


                               has a completed and signed promissory

                               note. After the fflrst disbursement is

                               made1 the school must record the actual

                               disbursed amount and the date of each

                               disbursement in the loan-origination

                               record and transmit all completed loan

                               records and promissory notes to the

                               Secretary. The school transmits

                               subsequent disbursement data to the

                               Secretary as the disbursements occur.


                               A school is required to reconcile cash and

                               individual loan records monthly. To

                               reconcile cash1 a school must provide

                               documentation that the total

                               disbursement minus cancellations1 plus

                               return of excess cash1 is equal to the

                               amount of money the school has drawn

                               down during a one-month period by the

                               end of the next month. For example1

                               loan records and promissory notes for all

                               disbursements and cancellations made in

                               'uly 1994 must be transmitted to the

                               Secretary by the end of August 1994. To

                               reconcile loan records1 a school:s records


                               must match the records of the Lirect





          Loan program Servicer. The software

          that is provided to participating schools
          is designed to assist schools in this

          reconciliation process.
          b. Schools That Use an Alternative

          Originator
          Schools that use an alternative originator

          transmit to the Lirect Loan program
          Servicer the data necessary for the Lirect

          Loan program Servicer to generate the
          combined promissory note)disclosure

          statement unless the school chooses to
          print the promissory note)disclosure

          statement on its premises. After the
          Lirect Loan program Servicer generates

          the promissory note)disclosure
          statement1 it is sent to the school or to

          the borrower depending upon the
          school:s established procedures. The

          borrower must complete the promissory
          note)disclosure statement and forward it

          as instructed to the Lirect Loan program
          Servicer or to the school. The Lirect

          Loan program Servicer must review the
          promissory note)disclosure statement
          before funds can be disbursed. lf the

          Lirect Loan program Servicer or the
          school determines that the promissory

          note)disclosure statement is not accurate
          or complete1 the promissory

          note)disclosure statement must be
          correct and complete before funds can be

          disbursed. The Lirect Loan program
          Servicer initiates drawdown of funds to

          the school based on the completed
          promissory note)disclosure statement.

          The school also receives a roster from the
          Lirect Loan program Servicer identifying

          each borrower1 the disbursement date
          and amount to be disbursed for each

          borrower1 and the total amount of funds
          received by the school. Schools that use

          alternative origination are still
          responsible for reporting actual

          disbursement data1 reconciling cash1 and
          returning funds that are not used or for

          which the borrower is not eligible.

          ln short1 the procedures used by a school

          that uses alternative origination differ in
          two ways from the procedures of

          originating schools. The fflrst is that a
          school under alternative origination may

          choose to designate the alternative
          originator as the manager of promissory

          note)disclosure statements. The second
          is that a school under alternative

          origination does not manage the funds
          draw down process; instead1 the school

          receives funds drawn down by the
          alternative originator only for those
          completed promissory notes in the

          possession of the alternative originator.

          The Secretary anticipates that issues
          related to participation of alternative

          originators in future years will be subdect
          to the negotiated rulemaying process.

          C. Federal Lirect pLUS Loans
          Federal Lirect pLUS loans are made

          through a process similar to the one used
          in the Federal pLUS loan program. The

          parent obtains a combined
          application)promissory note from the

          school and1 after completing the
          combined application)promissory note1

          sends it to the school. The school
          completes the school section of the

          application)promissory note and
          forwards it to the Lirect Loan program

          Servicer where data from the note is yey
          entered and a credit checy is performed.

          Alternatively1 a school enters data from
          the note using the software provided by

          the Lirect Loan program Servicer and
          electronically forwards this information

          to the Lirect Loan program Servicer. ln
          either case1 the Lirect Loan program

          Servicer performs a credit checy to
          determine1 as required by section

          42Wb(a) of the NEA1 whether the parent
          has an adverse credit history and notiffles

          the school and the parent of the results.
          lf the loan is approved1 the Lirect Loan

          program Servicer sends a disclosure
          statement to the parent. lf the credit
          checy indicates an adverse credit history1

          the Secretary advises the parent of
          available options; for example1 the parent

          could obtain an endorser without an
          adverse credit history. lf the loan is

          approved and the school originates loans1
          the school may draw down money and





                                disburse loan funds in the same manner

                                as it would for other loans made under
                                the Lirect Loan program. lf the school

                                does not originate loans1 the alternative
                                originator electronically transmits the

                                funding request for the school based on
                                the application)promissory notes that

                                the Lirect Loan program Servicer holds
                                for that school.
                                V. Loan Servicing
                                                 .
                                The Secretary ls responsible for servicing
                                and collecting Lirect Loans. As noted

                                above1 a notice specifflcally concerned
                                with repayment and collection will be

                                published shortly.
                                A school:s interaction with the Lirect

                                Loan program Servicer during the
                                servicing and collection of the loan is

                                similar to the interaction schools
                                currently have with lenders and guaranty

                                agencies in the FFEL program. Schools
                                must respond to periodic student status

                                confflrmation requests as well as to ad
                                hoc requests for information regarding

                                borrowers from the Lirect Loan program
                                Servicer.

                                borrowers who default on Lirect Loans
                                are added to EL:s debt collection system

                                and are subdect to all legally authoriked
                                default-collection activities.

                                Vl. lmpact of Other hules
                                Many of the provisions of the FFEL
                                program that are applicable to the Lirect

                                Loan program have been incorporated
                                into this notice of standards1 criteria1 and

                                procedures. The Secretary adopted those
                                provisions because schools are familiar

                                with them from their participation in the
                                FFEL program. Certain policies and

                                procedures currently being developed
                                through negotiated rulemaying for FFEL

                                program regulations will be adopted in
                                the Lirect Loan program1 including

                                policies relating to borrower forgiveness
                                for students who attended schools that

                                have closed or whose eligibility was
                                falsely certiffled and policies controlling

                                the deferment for economic hardship.

          b. Subpart b       borrower provisions

          Subpart b contains conditions of
          borrower eligibility1 which are identical to

          the borrower eligibility provisions in the
          FFEL program. The charges for which

          borrowers are responsible1 loan limits1
          deferment and forbearance options1 and

          borrower defenses to repayment are also
          included. The Student Loan heform Act

          of 1993 eliminated the Federal
          Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS)

          program but increased the loan limits for
          the Unsubsidiked Stafford program

          beginning 'uly 11 1994. The Nigher
          Education Technical Amendments of

           1993 further revised the loan limits. The
          revised loan limits are included in this

          notice along with a chart (Appendix A)
          which illustrates the loan limits that will
          be applicable as of 'uly 11 1994.

          C. Subpart C       hequirements1 Standards1

          and payments for Schools in the Lirect
          Loan program

          Subpart C contains those provisions
          governing a school:s participation in the

          Lirect Loan program1 including
          disbursement procedures1 entrance and

          exit counseling1 withdrawal procedures1
          recordyeeping and funds control

          requirements. The Secretary anticipates
          that schools will continue with the
          conscientious efforts demonstrated in the

          FFEL program in tailoring the
          counseling to the borrower:s particular

          needs and maying counseling accessible.
          These efforts have included1 for example1

          sign language interpreters for hearing
          impaired borrowers or translations for

          limited English profflcient borrowers.
          Executive Order 12W00

          The contents of this notice have been
          reviewed in accordance with Executive

          Order 12W00. Under the terms of the
          order1 the Secretary has assessed the

          potential costs and benefflts of the
          standards1 criteria1 and procedures in

          this notice.
          The potential costs associated with the

          contents of this notice are those resulting
          from statutory requirements and those

          determined by the Secretary to be
          necessary for administering this program

          effectively and eMciently. ln assessing
          the potential costs and benefflts        both





                                quantitative and qualitative of these

                                standards1 criteria1 and procedures1 the
                                Secretary has determined that the

                                benefflts of these standards1 criteria1 and
                                procedures dustify the costs.

                                The Secretary has also determined that
                                the contents of this notice do not unduly
                                interfere with State1 local1 and tribal

                                governments in the exercise of their
                                governmental functions.

                                The contents of this notice are consistent
                                with the requirements of the NEA and

                                promote the president:s priorities.
                                Waiver of hulemaying

                                lt is the practice of the Secretary to offer
                                interested parties an opportunity to

                                comment on proposed regulations.
                                Nowever1 public Law 103-00 requires

                                that the Secretary publish a notice in
                                lieu of regulations for the fflrst year of the

                                Lirect Loan program and exempts the
                                contents of the notice from the

                                rulemaying requirements of section 431
                                of the Oeneral Education provisions Act.

                                While the Secretary has consulted with
                                members of the higher education

                                community in the development of this
                                notice1 the statutory timeframe for the

                                program does not permit the solicitation
                                of further public comment. A public
                                comment period1 while helpful1 would

                                seriously delay the provision of necessary
                                guidance for the operation of the Lirect

                                Loan program. Therefore1 the Secretary
                                fflnds that solicitation of public comments

                                would be impracticable and contrary to

          Lemand side management has become

          increasingly important to electric utilities
          as they seey ways to maye their existing

          systems more eMcient and reduce the
          need for new capacity. hEA has

          supported demand side management
          (LSM) activities in the form of direct
          load control and energy conservation
                                            .
          through loans for control equlpment and
          principal deferment programs for energy

          conservation. With the passage of
          hELhA1 hEA is authoriked to expand

          its role and maye loans for all types of
          demand side management activities.

          This authority will be used primarily to
          fflnance distribution borrower needs.

          hEA believes that most LSM activities
          must be conducted at the distribution

          level because LSM impacts the
          consumer:s use of electricity. power

          supply borrowers are eligible for this
          fflnancing assistance1 but the level of

          investment required to support their
          distribution members in this area is not

          normally expected to require loan funds.
          hEA will not maye LSM loans or any

          type of loans directly to individuals.
          To be eligible for a loan for LSM

          programs1 which include energy
          conservation programs (except those

          fflnanced by loan principal deferments)1
          and for on-grid renewable energy

          systems1 the loan request must be
          supported by an hEA-approved

          integrated resource plan (lhp). hEA
          may also require an lhp1 on a case by

          case basis1 for certain large or unusual
          loans for off-grid renewable energy

          systems. LSM programs must also be
          supported by LSM plan1 which must be

          consistent with the borrower:s lhp.
          As defflned by the Energy policy Act of

          1992 (pub. L. 102-4WO) (Ep Act)1 an
          integrated resource plan is 44a planning

          and selection process for new energy
          resources that evaluates the full range of

          alternatives1 including new generation
          capacity1 power purchases1 energy

          conservation and eMciency1 cogeneration
          and district heating and cooling

          applications1 and renewable energy
          sources1 in order to provide adequate and
          reliable service at the lowest system cost.

          The process shall taye into account





                                necessary features for system operation1

                                such as diversity1 reliability1
                                dispatchability1 and other factors of risy

                                and shall taye into account the ability to
                                verify energy savings achieved through

                                energy conservation and eMciency and
                                the prodected durability of such savings

                                measured over time; and shall treat
                                demand and supply side resources on a

                                consistent and integrated basis.::
                                ln the regulatory text1 the term 44lhp:: is

                                used to refer to the result of the process
                                rather than the process.

                                The Ep Act also defflnes the term
                                44system cost:: to mean 44all direct and

                                quantifflable net costs for an energy

                                This subpart establishes policies and
                                requirements for lhps and LSM plans.

                                Many of these requirements are new1
                                although existing yy1110.233 and

                                1110.2341 and existing subparts E and O1
                                set forth analytical and related

                                requirements for the fflnancing of most
                                generation facilities that are the same in

                                many respects to the requirements of an
                                lhp. Oiven the expansion of hEA

                                lending authority in the relatively new
                                and sometimes uncertain areas of LSM

                                and renewable energy systems1 it is
                                essential that borrowers maye their

                                investment decisions based on an lhp in
                                order to ensure informed and prudent

                                investment planning.
                                lf a distribution borrower is a member of

                                a power supply borrower1 its requests for
                                LSM loans must be based on and be

                                consistent with the lhp of the power
                                supply borrower. The lhp of the power

                                supply borrower will establish which
                                LSM programs1 on-grid renewable energy

                                systems1 and traditional utility
                                investments1 among several feasible

                                alternatives1 are most cost-benefflcial
                                from the standpoint of the power supply

                                borrower and its members tayen as an
                                integrated system. The LSM programs

                                of the individual distribution members
                                must be coordinated among all parties to

                                ensure that the LSM programs of one





          member do not deopardike the fflnancial
                 .
          integrlty and loan security of any other
          member or that of the power supply
          borrower.

          Although LSM must be implemented at

          the distribution level1 a signifflcant
          portion of the benefflts and costs of LSM
          are accrued at the power supply level.

          These benefflts and costs are then
          transferred to the distribution borrower

          through wholesale rates. Consequently1
          LSM planning by distribution borrowers

          must consider the impacts of their
          activities on their power supplier and the

          implications of the power supplier:s
          wholesale rates.

          because of the relationship between a
          power supply borrower and its members

          and the relationship among the members
          of a power supply borrower1 it is

          imperative that the power supply
          borrower and its members coordinate

          lhp activities per y1110.330(b)(l) of this
          interim rule.

          lf a distribution borrower is not a
          member of a power supply borrower1 loan

          requests for LSM programs and on-grid
          renewable energy systems must be

          supported by the borrower:s own lhp.
          The lhp must address1 in particular1 any

          effects its LSM programs will have on
          the wholesale power rates charged by its
          non-hEA fflnanced power supplier.

          The requirements set forth for LSM

          plans and lhps are intended to provide
          guidance as these new requirements are
          implemented. Since these areas are new
          .
          ln many respects1 hEA intends to
          exercise its discretion to administer the

          specifflc requirements and procedures
          with a prudent degree of fflexibility1

          especially during the fflrst several months
          of implementation. Comments from the

          public are invited regarding the policies
          and requirements set forth herein for

          LSM plans and lhps.
          This rule includes citations to studies of

          the Electric power hesearch lnstitute
          (Ephl) and the U.S. Lepartment of

          Energy which are included as reader aids
          and do not imply hEA adoption or

          endorsement of said studies.
          This interim regulation will defflne LSM

          and renewable energy systems. lt will





                               also emphasike hEA commitment to

                               fflnance nontraditional (renewables1 LSM
                               and energy conservation systems) and

                               traditional resources on an equal footing.
                               borrowers requesting loans under this

                               subpart will be required to submit an
                               lhp and a LSM plan in most cases.

                               to be owned and operated by the

          programs are included as a LSM activity.
          (b) hEA will treat demand-side and

          supply-side resources on an equal basis.
          All requirements applicable to loans for

          traditional electric facilities will apply to
          loans for LSM. ln addition the

          requirements set forth in this subpart
          will apply.
